# LiteCowork build tasks and release checklist

This is the working delivery checklist for the active source tree. It is not a Git commit plan. Feature-specific work items belong in specs/NNN-*/TASKS.md. Product semantics remain in owner contracts; current evidence is in IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md.

## BT-00 — Current baseline and documentation integrity

| ID | Task | Exit evidence |
|---|---|---|
| BT-00.1 | Record exact branch/SHA/worktree and preserve ignored local archives | CURRENT-RUN.md; no destructive cleanup |
| BT-00.2 | Keep route inventory generated from composed production router | scripts/audit_served_routes.py --report matches schemas/served-route-inventory.json |
| BT-00.3 | Reconcile source/status/UI owners and stale references | IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md, semantic map, current inventory |
| BT-00.4 | **Validated** — Windows WorkspaceRoot private-locator route regressions | Six route tests pass on the declared Windows target; production locator validation remains fail-closed |
| BT-00.5 | Run documentation link and owner-contract guards | Markdown audit and cross-contract validator pass with reviewed exceptions only |
| BT-00.6 | Run frontend type/build/unit checks and packaged desktop smoke | Exact commands and results recorded |
| BT-00.7 | Release evidence and release-row schemas, release docs index | docs/schemas/release-evidence-bundle.schema.json, docs/schemas/release-matrix-row.schema.json, docs/release/README.md; 019-T02 |

## V1 release waves (2026-11-09)

The owner accepted packages 001-012 on 2026-11-09. Packages 013-020 are IN_REVIEW and each wave item for them starts only after that package's T01 records acceptance. A wave starts when its inputs below are met, not on a date.

| Wave | Packages | Inputs | Exit |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 | 011, 019 skeleton (019-T03..019-T05) | Acceptance recorded | Native CI runs `check.sh` plus the `src-tauri` workspace on Linux and Windows; IPC profiles qualified (011-T02, 011-T03) |
| W1 | 001, 002, 003, 014; then 012 after 001-T07 | W0 CI green | OpenCode v2.0.32 bindable (002-T01) and dispatching through a durable, single-flight, recoverable turn; E2E-01 and E2E-03 on the Windows row |
| W2 | 005 (Linux), 007, 009, 013 observe (013-T02..013-T06), 016 | 001 commit and recovery tasks done | E2E-04 on Linux, E2E-07, E2E-09, E2E-11 |
| W3 | 006, 013 plan/apply (013-T07..013-T18), 008 | 005 Environment and Trust wiring on Linux | E2E-05, E2E-06, E2E-08 |
| W4 | 004, 015, 020 | 002-T12 Claude Code module; 005 Attempt admission; 009 Coworker chat | E2E-02, proposed E2E-15 and E2E-17 |
| W5 | 010 | 005 execution handoff | E2E-10 |
| W6 | 017, 018, 019 qualification (019-T06..019-T23) | All earlier waves VERIFIED or explicitly descoped by the owner | E2E-12, proposed E2E-16, signed packages, V1 go/no-go |

Windows Task execution, the daemon terminal and Windows delegation stay UNAVAILABLE until B-35 is accepted and 005-T17/005-T18 qualify. That path runs in parallel with W3 to W5 and does not block the Linux row.

Folded tasks (owner-accepted 2026-11-09, register A-55) land in the wave of their owning package. The ACP native-agent client (002-T17, consumed by Feature 001) is the W1 adapter spine and carries the OpenCode fixture and normalizer (001-T23, 001-T24) plus the activity/plan cards, autoscroll and native permission prompts (001-T25, 001-T26, 001-T27); the Agent Matchmaker (002-T18) is W1. Per-block Markdown (016-T18) and the Context Debugger (003-T17) are W2. The LiteSPM pin (013-T20) is W3; the iframe sandbox guard and Git worktree/diff/PR (008-T19, 008-T20) are W3. Mission Control and read-only Compare (015-T20) is W4. The shell reachability, decomposition, SettingsPage merge and Workspace Dashboard tasks (011-T19..011-T22) ride the W0 shell package, with the Dashboard deliverable landing once its inputs exist. The operator-api.ts codegen and drift gate (018-T18) is W6. The V1 go/no-go (019-T23) re-synced its VERIFIED-id list to the new final task ids.

## Migration allocation (provisional)

The wired schema is v30 (v30 adds REPORTED turn activity records, 001-T25 storage layer): v28 (register A-40) and v29 (Feature 001 durable turn) are applied by `crates/storage-sqlite/src/lib.rs`. Many packages wrote "sqlite-v29.sql or the next free number" and Feature 012 named v30, so the numbers collide. This table assigns numbers in wave merge order. Rules: the first package to bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` also wires v28, because migrations apply in order; a package that merges out of order takes the next free number and updates this table in the same change; a merged migration is never renumbered or edited.

| Migration | Package and task | Content (from the package DATA-MODEL) |
|---|---|---|
| v28 (existing) | wired by 001 (done) | Workspace delegation settings revisions (A-40) |
| v29 (wired) | 001 (W1, done) | Dispatch outbox, single-flight triggers, commit identity table, usage records |
| v30, v31 | 002-T04, 002-T07 (W1) | Runtime-local descriptor store; auth observations |
| v32 | 003-T09 (W1) | `context_attachments`, `retrieval_receipts` |
| v33 | 014 (W1) | Conversation status columns, search index, deletion tombstone and purge manifest |
| v34 | 012-T05 (W1, replaces the v30 named in 012) | Control events and side notes |
| v35 | 005-T01 (W2) | Plan acceptance, Attempt admission and Effect records |
| v36 | 007-T01 (W2) | `artifact_export_receipts`, source Conversation columns |
| v37 | 009 (W2) | Conversation Coworker origin and memory fields |
| v38 | 013 (W2/W3) | Package approvals and operation receipts |
| v39 | 006-T01 (W3) | `connections` rebuild and Connection records |
| v40 | 008-T01 (W3) | Browser session/lease/receipt and terminal session/receipt |
| v41 | 015 (W4) | `task_control_requests`, `task_resume_packets` |
| v42 | 020-T02 (W4) | `learning_candidates`, `coworker_learning_policies`, `memory_records` |
| v43 | 010-T01 (W5) | Delivery lease and status transitions, SUPPRESSED rows |
| v44 | 017 (W6) | `backup_operations` |
| v45 (if needed) | 018 (W6) | Optional diagnostics table; the usage table comes from 001 |

Packages 004, 011, 016 and 019 plan no migration.

## Cross-package dependency graph

Each edge "A -> B" means B needs A's named outcome. Edges are taken from each package's PLAN.md and TASKS.md "Depends on" lines.

```text
011 (IPC, shell)           -> every package with UI or Operator routes
019 skeleton (CI)         -> every package qualification task
002-T01 (bindable OpenCode) -> 001-T04, 001-T09
001 (turn commit, Stop)   -> 012, 014, 016-T08, 018-T03, 004
001-T15 (usage records)   -> 018-T05
002-T12 (Claude Code)     -> 004-T05, 015-T08
003 (retrieval)           -> 009-T07, 014-T13
005 (Environment, Attempt) -> 006-T07, 008-T09, 010-T08, 015
005-T17 (Windows, B-35)   -> 008-T12, 015-T18, 005-T18
013-T14 (bridge handoff)  -> 006 package-backed capabilities
007 (Artifact create)     -> 016-T10
009 (Coworker chat)       -> 020-T09
010 quiet hours           -> 020-T06
011-T13/T14 (quiescence)  -> 019-T11, 019-T19
all package VERIFIED tasks -> 019-T23 (V1 go/no-go)
```

## Parallel documentation and validation

- Update owner documents, schemas, UI contract, action ledger and SDD wiring together.
- Keep the route inventory current after every Operator router/OpenAPI change.
- Run the served-route validator, Markdown audit and cross-contract validator.
- Run the feature package validator.
- Run Rust, frontend, packaged desktop and owner tests for the affected slice.
- Do not mark a story/SDD VERIFIED because a static script or unit suite passes.


# Documentation authority and navigation

The documentation set defines LiteCowork's product, architecture, owner-domain behavior, machine contracts, UI interactions, implementation boundaries and release evidence. The active executable implementation is in apps/ and crates/. Documentation, source and tests serve different purposes: normative contracts define intended behavior; source identifies what is implemented and wired; tests identify exercised cases; CODE/SYSTEM/USER evidence determines qualification.

## Authority order

1. Root ARCHITECTURE.md: global invariants, ownership, trust boundaries and execution model.
2. PRODUCT.md and V1-PRODUCT-RELEASE-CONTRACT.md: product promise, user model and V1/V2 boundary.
3. Domain owner contracts and accepted ADRs: authoritative semantics for their domains.
4. schemas/: canonical OpenAPI, JSON Schema, event and immutable SQLite migration contracts.
5. V1 UI contracts, function/settings ledgers, coverage maps and generated types: traceability, not independent semantic authority.
6. IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md: source-backed status for the active checkout; it does not rewrite target requirements.
7. CODE, SYSTEM and USER qualification evidence: proof for an exact build, platform, provider, agent, account route and behavior.
8. IMPLEMENTATION-MASTER-PLAN.md: delivery order only; it does not change owner semantics.

Do not create a second schema authority. Promote machine contracts in schemas/ and their owning domain document together. Do not silently resolve contradictions by choosing the most recently dated file.

## Feature specification workflow

A material change requires a complete feature package under ../specs/ conforming to SPECIFICATION-STANDARD.md and ../.specify/templates/. A package validator checks structure; it does not approve design or implementation.

Each package records scope, owner decisions, API/event/error references, data model, wiring, tasks, research, security, failure/recovery and UI behavior. Update the owning global contract and machine schemas where needed, then update the SDD, UI/action ledgers, coverage and traceability.

The feature lifecycle is DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → ACCEPTED/LOCKED → IMPLEMENTING → VERIFIED, with BLOCKED and SUPERSEDED as explicit states. Do not mark a package accepted without owner review.

## Reference implementations and derived reading notes

repo_take/ contains pinned external source repositories for engineering research. They are not product dependencies or source of truth. Record exact repository, commit, relevant files, adopted/rejected idea and LiteCowork invariant affected in REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATIONS.md or the relevant SDD RESEARCH.md.

reading/ contains derived source-reading digests and audit snapshots. It is a navigation aid only, not an authority or current implementation record. Recheck every claim against the active owner document and source. The active corpus manifest and Markdown audit deliberately exclude reading/ so stale digests cannot affect current product/release counts.

## Historical records

docs/archive/ preserves historical research, old implementation plans and evidence snapshots. They are useful for provenance but do not establish the active checkout's implementation or release status. The active source is apps/ and crates/. Use IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md for current implementation evidence.

## Evidence vocabulary

Use TARGET, CODE, SERVED, INTEGRATED and QUALIFIED. TARGET is normative design; CODE is compiled or unit-exercised; SERVED is an authenticated mounted operation connected to its owning service/storage path; INTEGRATED is a real provider/harness and persisted product path; QUALIFIED is exact OS/build/provider/auth-route evidence with CODE, SYSTEM and owner USER acceptance, including negative and recovery cases. No route count, catalog, UI tile or unit test alone qualifies a product journey.

# Errors and recovery - Conversation co-edit and take-control

## Target behavior

Take-control settles the turn `CANCELLED` only after the Feature 001 supervisor observes native stop/quiescence. If a completion or failure wins the race, that terminal outcome remains authoritative and take-control reports it instead of a fabricated cancellation. The stopped turn's committed content is preserved as owner-editable context, and the Conversation enters an explicit owner-in-control state recorded by an immutable `OWNER_TOOK_CONTROL` control event.

A side-chat `OWNER_SIDE_NOTE` is valid only while its correlated turn is non-terminal. It is committed as ordinary bounded history, displayed with its correlated turn id, and excluded from that turn's native prompt. It never admits a second concurrent active turn.

Stale Conversation/turn versions, idempotency-key reuse with a different payload, quiescence timeout, and Runtime restart use the canonical Feature 001 error and recovery contracts. This package introduces no duplicate error taxonomy.

## Typed errors (PROPOSED)

- `TakeControlError::TurnAlreadyTerminal` - the target turn has already settled; no control event or new turn is created.
- `TakeControlError::StaleTurnVersion` - the supplied turn version does not match; the owner must refresh.
- `TakeControlError::QuiescenceTimeout` - native stop was not observed within the finite deadline; the turn is not falsely settled `CANCELLED`.
- `TakeControlError::RacedCompletionWins` - a completion/failure won the race; the terminal outcome is authoritative.
- `SideNoteError::TurnTerminal` - the correlated turn is terminal; the note is rejected and the draft preserved.
- `SideNoteError::OverBudget` - the note exceeds the bounded size; it is refused, never silently truncated.
- `SideNoteError::CrossWorkspace` - the note or correlation crosses the Workspace boundary and is rejected.

## Crash and restart

Reload the last committed Conversation turn, control events and side-notes. Do not infer a stop from an intent: if quiescence was not observed and no terminal settlement committed, the turn is reconciled through the Feature 001 restart rules, not shown as taken over. After an `OWNER_TOOK_CONTROL` event, restart restores the owner-in-control state and the preserved stopped-turn content from committed records only.

## Current gaps

- The Feature 001 cancel path does not observe native interrupt/quiescence and the UI Stop is ineffective for the OpenCode path (register A-25). Take-control recovery cannot be called reliable until those defects are closed.
- There is no control-event or side-note store today; the proposed records are not persisted.
- The context-package builder has no side-note exclusion yet; the exclusion is a new requirement under AC-007.

## Qualification gate

Take-control quiescence, racing completion, terminal-turn rejection, idempotent replay, side-note exclusion from the prompt, single-flight, crash and restart must be exercised on each declared OS/auth route. A source-level unit test or mounted route does not qualify the co-edit journey.

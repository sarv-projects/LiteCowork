# Research and Decision Log - Data Portability, Backup and Restore

**Feature:** 017 | **Status:** IN_REVIEW - pending owner acceptance of B-41; does not authorize implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.
**Checked:** 2026-11-09 - source audit of the checkout on branch `docs/audit-competitor-superset`; external sources are not web-verified in this pass.

## 1. Repository sources inspected

| Source | Path | Finding | Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLI | `apps/litecoworkd/src/backup_operator.rs`, `apps/litecoworkd/src/main.rs` (line 55, HELP) | Four subcommands, one JSON document each, passphrase from file, restore must never be on the Operator socket | `verify`/`restore` use `current_dir()` as service root; no CLI tests for backup in `apps/litecoworkd/tests/cli.rs` |
| Storage contract | `crates/storage-core/src/backup.rs` | Container constants, 26 excluded tables, revoked-on-restore list, manifest and outcome types, schema verdict | Exclusion is a deny list |
| Storage implementation | `crates/storage-sqlite/src/backup.rs` | `VACUUM INTO` snapshot, excluded-table trim with trigger restore, chunked XChaCha20-Poly1305, PBKDF2, read-back verification, staging, all-or-nothing restore, live-lock refusal, grant revocation, 11 tests | No per-Workspace row filter; blobs need source keys; Windows directories not DACL-protected; `restored_at` from manifest |
| Key provider | `crates/storage-sqlite/src/os_key_provider.rs` (`OsWorkspaceBlobKeyProvider`, `keyring` crate 3.6.3) | Workspace blob keys live in the OS keystore | Keys are per OS user and machine |
| Windows security | `crates/windows-local-security/src/lib.rs` (`secure_current_user_directory`, `secure_current_user_file`) | Owner-only DACL helpers exist; `storage-sqlite` already depends on the crate | Not called by backup code |
| Schema | `docs/schemas/sqlite-v1.sql` (`workspace_backup_manifests`), `docs/schemas/sqlite-v28.sql` (latest) | Immutable manifest table | No operation table |
| API | `docs/schemas/operator-api.openapi.yaml` lines 214-276; `docs/schemas/served-route-inventory.json` | Four backup operations declared; all `target_only` | Restore operation conflicts with CLI rule |
| Owner prose | `docs/STORAGE.md` "Backup and disaster recovery", `docs/FAILURE-RECOVERY.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md` "Secrets" | Workspace-filtered snapshot, new Runtime identity, tombstone/purge carry, secrets never in storage | STORAGE says "Workspace-filtered"; code does not filter rows |
| Product | `docs/V1-PRODUCT-RELEASE-CONTRACT.md` Area 10 and section 6 invariant 6; `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-MASTER-PLAN.md` P11; `docs/ACCEPTANCE-AND-E2E-PLAN.md` E2E-12 | Backups/recovery required; delete fences; E2E-12 integrity, secret exclusion, tombstone and evidence preservation | Target |
| Settings | `docs/V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT.md` category 13; `docs/V1-SETTINGS-CONTRACT-LEDGER.md` rows `previewBackup` to `confirmRestore`, `inspectStorageUsage` | Explicit preview and receipt; no silent overwrite | Ledger is proposed design |
| UI | `apps/litecowork-ui/src/settings/SettingsView.tsx` | Four categories only | No backup UI |
| Deletion | `apps/litecoworkd/src/operator.rs` context-document deletion routes; `apps/litecowork-ui/src-tauri/src/context_document_deletion_bridge.rs`; `runtime_workspace_replay_process_tests.rs` | Per-Resource purge with restart reconciliation test | No Workspace-level list |

## 2. Pinned external sources

| Source | Version or SHA | License | Use | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RustCrypto `chacha20poly1305` | 0.10.1 (`crates/storage-sqlite/Cargo.toml`) | Apache-2.0 OR MIT | XChaCha20-Poly1305 container chunks | Keep (already a dependency) |
| RustCrypto `hmac` | 0.12.1 (`crates/storage-sqlite/Cargo.toml`) | Apache-2.0 OR MIT | Current hand-written PBKDF2 core | Keep; replace hand-written loop with RustCrypto `pbkdf2` after a test vector proves identical output (F-03) |
| `keyring` | 3.6.3 (`crates/storage-sqlite/Cargo.toml`) | Apache-2.0 OR MIT | OS keystore access for blob keys | Keep; never export key material |
| `fs2` | 0.4 | Apache-2.0 OR MIT | Runtime lock probe | Keep |
| SQLite `VACUUM INTO` | SQLite bundled by `rusqlite` in `Cargo.lock` | Public domain | Consistent snapshot without long writer lock | Keep; add row filter on the copy |
| nightly-labs/openbot | `6759fa3ee857f4f4966865e12de99ae84ab6de07` ([REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATIONS.md](../../docs/REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATIONS.md) REF-OPENBOT) | PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 | Reference for deleting usage with an agent; no backup feature was found in the cited files | Reject copying code (license); concept only |

Not pinned and used as concepts only: age file encryption format and restic/borg repository designs (considered for portable format; rejected for V1 because the existing `LCBK1` container already meets the requirements and switching would break existing archives).

## 3. Alternatives considered

| Topic | Alternative | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace scope | Keep whole-database copy and label it installation backup | Rejected: contradicts STORAGE "Workspace-filtered" and leaks other Workspaces |
| Workspace scope | Build snapshot by `ATTACH` + `INSERT SELECT` per table | Rejected for V1: loses byte-identical schema the restore path relies on; delete-on-copy is simpler |
| Portability | Export blob keys wrapped by the passphrase | Rejected: key material would leave the keystore (L-05) |
| Portability | Re-encrypt blob plaintext inside the container (B-41 PROPOSED) | Proposed |
| Restore over live | Replace a live Workspace in place | Rejected: no safe fence for in-flight turns, leases and readers |
| Restore over live | Import only an absent Workspace; whole restore offline (B-41 PROPOSED) | Proposed |
| Passphrase transport | File path as the CLI does | Rejected for desktop: the UI would need to write a secret file; IPC no-store body is used, except the sidecar offline restore which uses an owner-only temp file deleted immediately |
| KDF | Argon2id now | Deferred to a container v2 (F-03, O-05) |

## 4. Verified source defects (inputs to tasks)

1. `build_filtered_snapshot` does not filter rows by Workspace (T03).
2. `ensure_private_directory` applies no DACL on Windows (T04).
3. `restore_into_staging` sets `restored_at` from `manifest.verified_at` (T04).
4. `new_runtime_identity_required: true` is reported but no identity is minted (T04).
5. No startup sweep of `.backup-staging-*` (T04).
6. `verify`/`restore` CLI service root is `current_dir()` (T04).
7. Blob envelopes require the source keystore (T05).
8. OpenAPI `restoreWorkspaceBackup` on the live Operator contradicts the CLI header rule (T02).

## 5. Performance baseline (to be filled by 017-T14)

| Fixture | Rows | Blob bytes | OS/build | Create time | Verify time | Peak RSS growth | Operator p95 during create |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

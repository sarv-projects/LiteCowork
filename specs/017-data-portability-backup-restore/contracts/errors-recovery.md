# Error and Recovery Contract - Feature 017

**Status:** IN_REVIEW - pending owner acceptance of B-41; does not authorize implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.
**Owners:** Storage, Operator/API, Runtime Lifecycle, Security, Desktop UI.
**Canonical owners:** [Failure Recovery](../../../docs/FAILURE-RECOVERY.md), [Storage](../../../docs/STORAGE.md), [API](../../../docs/API.md), [Security](../../../docs/SECURITY.md).

## 1. Error classes (PROPOSED codes promoted by 017-T02)

| Code | HTTP | Cause | Server action | Client action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FORBIDDEN` / `NOT_FOUND` (existing) | 403 / 404 | Foreign principal or Workspace | Deny before any work | Do not retry unchanged |
| `BACKUP_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS` | 409 | Another nonterminal operation | No write | Show the running operation |
| `BACKUP_ARCHIVE_INVALID` | 422 | Bad magic or version, truncated, size or count over cap, path escape, digest mismatch | Stop before staging rows | Offer choosing another file |
| `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE_REJECTED` | 422 | Wrong passphrase, or too short on create | No key material retained | Re-enter passphrase |
| `BACKUP_SCHEMA_INCOMPATIBLE` | 422 | Archive schema newer than Runtime or below minimum | No staging | Show required build |
| `WORKSPACE_IMPORT_CONFLICT` | 409 | Archive Workspace id already exists | No write | Explain no overwrite or merge in V1 |
| `RUNTIME_RUNNING` | 409 | Offline restore while Runtime lock held | No write | Retry after stop |
| `BACKUP_INTERRUPTED` | n/a (operation state) | Previous incarnation crashed mid-operation | Startup sweep removes staging and partial archive | Offer to start again |
| `DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE` (existing) | 503 | Keystore unavailable, disk error | Settle FAILED, delete partial archive | Show repair path |
| `STALE_VERSION` (existing) | 412 | Stale If-Match on cancel | No change | Refresh operation |

## 2. Recovery rules

- **Create crash:** the archive is written under a temporary name and renamed only after read-back verification; the manifest is published in the same transaction as SUCCEEDED. On restart, `sweep_backup_staging` removes `.backup-staging-*` and unpublished archive files and settles the operation FAILED `BACKUP_INTERRUPTED`.
- **Create uncertain outcome:** the client replays with the same Idempotency-Key; the daemon returns the stored operation. It never creates a second archive for one key.
- **Import crash:** staging is outside the live database; the live import commit is one transaction. Before commit nothing is visible; after commit the Workspace is complete. Startup sweep handles staging.
- **Offline restore crash:** the destination is a new directory and the swap is a rename after success. If the swap did not happen, the original installation restarts unchanged. If it did, the restored installation starts, mints a new Runtime identity and resumes purge reconciliation.
- **Cancellation race:** cancel is honored only before the commit point (seal for create, transaction for import). After it, cancel returns the committed state.
- **Duplicate replay:** same principal, key and payload returns the original operation; same key with a changed payload fails with the existing `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` code.
- **Disk full:** the operation fails with `DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`, deletes partial files and never publishes a manifest.
- **Keystore unavailable on import:** fail before commit; no plaintext blob is left on disk.
- **Lost passphrase:** unrecoverable by design; the UI warns before create.

## 3. Restored authority (never live again)

On every restore and import: `capability_grants` REVOKED, `execution_leases`, `environment_control_leases` and `secret_leases` absent, `runtime_incarnations` STOPPED, new Runtime identity on first start, Connections need re-authentication, AgentSessions from the backup are not resumable.

## 4. Delete fences across restore

Acknowledged purged content is never reintroduced. Pending purge targets resume reconciliation before the restored Workspace serves retrieval or context. A target is shown as purged only after its acknowledgement commits.

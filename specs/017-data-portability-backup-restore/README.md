# 017 - Data Portability, Backup and Restore

- **Status:** IN_REVIEW - authored 2026-11-09 after the owner acceptance packet; B-41 is PROPOSED and pending owner review; does not authorize implementation and is not a claim of implementation or qualification.
- **Revision:** 0.1 | **Updated:** 2026-11-09 | **Delivery wave:** Wave 6 (gate G) | **E2E:** E2E-12 | **Master plan:** P11
- **Owners:** Storage, Operator/API, Desktop UI, Security/Trust, Runtime Lifecycle and Product.

## User outcome

From Settings > Storage & Backup the owner can create and verify an encrypted Workspace backup, export a portable archive, import it into another installation, restore an installation offline after a safe Runtime stop, and confirm that deletions, tombstones, Evidence and provenance survived, with no secret ever carried.

## Current truth

`litecoworkd backup create|verify|restore|upgrade-check` exists as a CLI (`apps/litecoworkd/src/backup_operator.rs`) over a real encrypted container implementation (`crates/storage-sqlite/src/backup.rs`, `LocalBackupService`) with 11 storage tests. Nothing is reachable from the desktop: the four backup operations in OpenAPI are target-only, there is no Tauri command and no Settings category. Source reading found that the snapshot is not filtered to the requested Workspace, portable restore on a new machine is impossible because blob keys stay in the source OS keystore, a crash can leave a plaintext staging snapshot, Windows staging has no owner-only DACL, and the restore receipt reports the wrong time. See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) section 4.

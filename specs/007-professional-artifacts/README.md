# 007 - Professional Artifacts One Format

**Status:** ACCEPTED/LOCKED - owner-accepted 2026-11-09; authorizes implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.
**Revision:** 1.0 | **Updated:** 2026-11-09
**Implementation state (2026-11-10):** Not implemented. T12 BLOCKED for the Task-generated class; migration v37 allocated.
**Owners:** Artifacts, Presentation, Storage, Desktop UI.
**Owner acceptance:** repository owner (sarv-projects), 2026-11-09, via [docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md](../../docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md). Accepted: B-21 Markdown (`text/markdown`) first with no Office engine, B-30 `POST /v1/artifacts` create, B-31 `ArtifactExportReceipt` distinct from native Save As.
**Release target:** V1 release matrix rows Windows 11/10 `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` first; Linux x86_64 desktop second.

## User outcome

The owner creates, revises, exports and reopens one professional deliverable (a Markdown document) and can see provenance, the source Conversation and version differences. Other formats are honestly read-only or unsupported.

## Current truth

The active checkout has an Artifact read/Library/version model and a narrow managed `text/plain` append editor (`apps/litecoworkd/src/artifact_operator.rs`, `apps/litecowork-ui/src/artifacts/`). It has no production Artifact create command, no Markdown editor, no durable export-receipt flow, no declared capability matrix and no Conversation association (`ArtifactRecord` carries `task_id` only). Previewing Markdown/CSV/JSON is not editing those formats; uploading DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/PDF creates a Resource, not an Artifact. Native Save As (`artifact_save_as`, `resource_save_as`) is an exact-version local file save, not the export receipt. Acceptance authorizes implementation and does not change these facts; see SPEC.md §4 and docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md.

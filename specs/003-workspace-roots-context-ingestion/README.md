# 003 - Workspace Roots and Context Ingestion

**Status:** ACCEPTED/LOCKED - owner-accepted 2026-11-09; authorizes implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.
**Revision:** 1.0 | **Updated:** 2026-11-11
**Implementation state (2026-11-11):** Selected CODE/SERVED foundations only. WorkspaceRoot list/pause/resume/revoke/scan and paginated metadata-observation routes exist; Linux root lifecycle storage tests pass. Native folder add is supported on Linux/macOS but fails closed on Windows; metadata scan is Linux-only and does not read/index content. Grounded lexical retrieval is served, but Send does not call it and no durable ContextAttachment/retrieval receipt or “Context Used” projection exists. T08 is PARTIAL; T02 is PARTIAL; ingestion, indexing, attachment/retrieval integration, Context Debugger and qualification remain open. Windows root operations require native Windows testing; migration v35 remains allocated and unwritten. See TASKS.md and docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md.
**Owners:** Resource, Conversation, Storage, Security/Trust, Desktop UI.
**Owner acceptance:** repository owner (sarv-projects), 2026-11-09, via [docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md](../../docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md). B-13 (UTF-8 lexical text set first) and B-14 (manual rescan, no V1 watcher) are accepted.
**Release target:** V1 release matrix rows Windows 11/10 `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` with OpenCode v2.0.32 first; Linux x86_64 desktop second.

## User outcome

The owner attaches a folder as a persistent WorkspaceRoot, asks a grounded question with citations from exact revisions, and revokes the root so later retrieval is fenced.

## Current truth

The active checkout contains the Rust daemon, Tauri desktop application and shared crates. Owner acceptance authorizes implementation of this package; it does not change what the code does. Today Windows root add returns 503 (`create_workspace_root_from_native_selection` fallback in `apps/litecoworkd/src/operator.rs`), scan returns 501 `SCAN_UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM` on every non-Linux target (`apps/litecoworkd/src/workspace_root_scan_operator.rs`), grounded retrieval (`apps/litecoworkd/src/rag_retrieval_operator.rs`) is not called by Send and writes no receipt, there is no persisted ContextAttachment, and the composer sends `resourceRefs: []`. The implementation boundary is mapped in SPEC.md §4 and docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md; do not infer qualification from a matching route, type or screen.

By owner approval on 2026-11-09 (see [docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md](../../docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md)), this package folds proposed task P-15 (003-T17, Context Debugger surface showing exactly what entered model context).

## Dependencies

Feature 001 owns Send, the composer and ResourceRef materialization (B-08); this package owns WorkspaceRoots, ContextAttachments, retrieval receipts, Context Used and the ResourceRef picker it surfaces in the 001 composer. Feature 011 owns the Tauri shell and the Windows named-pipe Operator IPC. Feature 014 consumes the retrieval fences on Conversation delete.

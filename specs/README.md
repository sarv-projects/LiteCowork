
# Feature specification packages

This directory contains the feature-level Software Design Document packages for LiteCowork V1. IDs are stable and must not be renamed after acceptance. The normative global architecture, product, domain and machine contracts remain under docs/.

## Package lifecycle

DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → ACCEPTED/LOCKED → IMPLEMENTING → VERIFIED. A package validator checks required files and structure; it does not accept design or establish implementation/qualification.

Owner acceptance was recorded on 2026-11-09 in [OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md](../docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md). Packages 001-012 are ACCEPTED/LOCKED; 013-020 were added from the V1 gap analysis and are IN_REVIEW until the whole SPEC of each is accepted. On 2026-11-10 the owner accepted B-38 to B-41, D-01 and B-45 as proposed, deferred all of 013, every Windows row and the release-dependent rows (B-43, B-44), and left B-42 and the B-19 follow-up open (register A-62). Code status per package is in [../CURRENT-RUN.md](../CURRENT-RUN.md) "Handoff status by package" and each package README. Every package carries a V1 TASKS.md that ends in a "Package VERIFIED for V1" task; the release go/no-go is 019-T23. Delivery waves are in [LITECOWORK-BUILD-TASKS.md](../docs/LITECOWORK-BUILD-TASKS.md).

On the same 2026-11-09 review the owner also approved folding the proposed tasks P-05 and P-11..P-19 (with the P-00..P-09 rendering and shell set) into their owning packages, including the LOCKED ones, under the ACP native-agent transport direction (register [A-54](../docs/CONTRADICTION-AND-ALIGNMENT-REGISTER.md)). The native-agent adapter (Feature 002 002-T17, consumed by Feature 001) is now defined as an Agent Client Protocol (ACP) client with a per-provider launch catalog, keeping the OpenCode v2 HTTP path as one non-ACP adapter until its ACP route qualifies. The folded tasks pushed several packages to new final ids (001 to T28, 002 to T19, 003 to T18, 008 to T21, 011 to T23, 013 to T21, 015 to T21, 016 to T19, 018 to T19); always read the current TASKS.md for the exact ids. The capability-to-task coverage map is [V1-PRODUCT-FEATURE-COVERAGE.md](../docs/V1-PRODUCT-FEATURE-COVERAGE.md).

Every new package's RESEARCH.md must record pinned repository SHAs, current vendor documentation links, a copy/prototype/reject decision against LiteCowork invariants and unresolved questions with accountable owners. Tests must name executable commands and evidence outputs. UI contracts must cite the live flow IDs in [FLOWS.md](../docs/FLOWS.md) (F00–F143) and the feature EARS acceptance IDs. The legacy `UIV1-xxx` namespace is retired as an active acceptance authority (register [A-39](../docs/CONTRADICTION-AND-ALIGNMENT-REGISTER.md)); treat any UIV1 citation as a provenance pointer to the archived catalog only.

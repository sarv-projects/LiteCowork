# Research - Agent Relay on One Conversation

**Feature:** 004 | **Checked:** 2026-11-06; re-checked 2026-11-09 for the Claude Code arm and desktop producer path.

**Status:** ACCEPTED/LOCKED - owner-accepted 2026-11-09; authorizes implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.

## Sources

Authorities: docs/DELEGATION.md (to avoid collapsing relay into HOST_DELEGATED), docs/NATIVE-COMPOSER-LLD.md, docs/FLOWS.md, feature 001. Reject vendor multi-agent routers that share one hidden transcript. Owner-contract references are retained as design constraints; current source/route/UI evidence is recorded below.

## Findings

- The owner documents already decide the trust boundaries this slice must keep.
- Hosted competitors often collapse connection, permission and execution into one toggle. LiteCowork forbids that collapse.
- Reference desktop repositories are architecture comparisons, not code to vendor. Pins and paths: [REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATIONS.md](../../docs/REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATIONS.md), [REFERENCE-REPOS-CORE-ARCHITECTURE-INDEX.md](../../docs/REFERENCE-REPOS-CORE-ARCHITECTURE-INDEX.md).

| OpenWork lazy capability gateway (`search_capabilities`/`execute_capability`) | https://github.com/different-ai/openwork/tree/5493b18a6af64d56454658a53da00eabbc6e033d | MIT except `/ee` (Enterprise Edition License) | The lazy gateway pattern shows admission of a named operation without holding provider state in the caller; it maps to building each relay turn's input from committed records rather than a live A session. | Prototype the admission shape; do not import `/ee` paths or adopt the OpenCode loop as a second authority. |
| OpenWork `packages/automations` engine/ports doctrine (`engine.ts`, `ports.ts`, `contracts.ts`) | https://github.com/different-ai/openwork/blob/5493b18a6af64d56454658a53da00eabbc6e033d/packages/automations/src/engine.ts | MIT except `/ee` | Receipts/events/results stay readable after the admitting process stops. This validates relay reloading only committed turns and rebuilding B's input from durable state, never a cached A handle. | Prototype the durable-readable doctrine against STATE-MACHINES; do not vendor the TypeScript runtime. |

These confirm that a second agent's input can be a pure function of durable committed state, which is exactly the portable-context contract B-15 proposes. No OpenWork code is imported; the patterns are prototype/reference inputs only.

## Source and route audit (2026-11-06)

Inspected the composed Conversation route in `apps/litecoworkd/src/conversation_operator.rs`, `apps/litecoworkd/src/agents/supervisor.rs`, `agents/codex_app_server.rs`, `agents/codex_profile_probe.rs`, `agents/conversation_prompt.rs`, the context package builder and reader in `crates/storage-core/src/conversation.rs` and `crates/storage-sqlite/src/conversations.rs`, `apps/litecowork-ui/src/conversations/ConversationsPage.tsx`, `conversation-agent-selection.ts`, `conversation-agent-surface.ts`, and the generated `operator-api.ts` contract.

- `PATCH /v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/agent-binding` is composed and served by `conversation_operator.rs`. It requires the selected Workspace, `If-Match` version and `Idempotency-Key`, commits `conversation.agent_binding.changed.v1`, and returns the updated Conversation. The desktop also uses its Tauri command bridge to persist the selected binding for future turns.
- A submitted turn pins `agent_binding_id` in `conversation.turn.created.v2`. The Conversation message projection includes `agent_binding_id` and `agent_session_id`; these are available as source data for producer attribution. This is not the same as the UI displaying that attribution.
- `AgentSessionSupervisor::execute_agent_turn` has one provider arm: `provider_key == "opencode"`. It spawns a bounded OpenCode v2.0.32 server, creates a fresh native session, activates the durable Conversation AgentSession and sends the portable prompt. Other provider keys reach the unsupported/unconfigured path. The current implementation therefore has one adapter branch, not two.
- `CodexAppServer` includes a context-aware `turn_start_with_conversation_context` method and protocol tests, but the type is used by Codex profile probing and is not integrated into `AgentSessionSupervisor::execute_agent_turn`. Its existence is not a Codex Conversation execution path.
- Feature 002's OpenCode profile probe deliberately records `compatible=false`; the AgentCatalog UI therefore does not allow a new OpenCode binding to be created from that probe. Codex can produce a compatible/startable profile observation and an enabled lead-eligible binding, but the Conversation supervisor has no Codex dispatch arm. Thus the current visible picker cannot provide a complete supported A→B→A sequence.
- `buildConversationAgentChoices` filters by same Workspace, `enabled`, `leadEligible`, unique binding identity and active Conversation supervisor adapter support. It does not check whether a fresh AgentControlDescriptor/auth observation exists. The descriptor-aware `deriveConversationAgentSurface` helper has tests but no production import/call site; Feature 002's descriptor route is wired but still fails closed with 503 absent a qualified producer.
- The backend message projection and desktop `ConversationMessageView`/`parseConversationSnapshot` retain nullable `agent_binding_id` and `agent_session_id`; committed messages display their producer from the stored binding. Focused UI tests cover producer parsing and immutable stream identity. This does not establish a second provider or cross-layer relay.
- The composer `Add context or file` control opens a Resource picker and sends eligible text ResourceRefs for an existing Conversation. Binary files, WorkspaceRoot files and first-message attachment on a new Conversation remain unavailable; the control does not connect workspace retrieval or Context Used receipts.
- The storage layer builds `ConversationContextPackage` through the exact committed USER-message event revision, orders by aggregate revision, excludes `SYSTEM_NOTICE`, and carries prior AGENT messages' source binding identity. The native prompt encoder rejects any nonempty `resource_refs` and RESOURCE content using `ResourceMaterializationRequired`; no Resource materializer is wired into this relay path.
- Internal bounds are 1,024 source messages / 4 MiB for the context package and 256 KiB for the encoded native text prompt. B-15 was accepted on 2026-11-09 with these as the V1 bounds; they are not yet promoted into SCHEMAS.md/OpenAPI (004-T01).
- Changing the Conversation binding commits Conversation state only. It does not create a Task, Attempt, DelegationProfile, Environment, lease, grant or Task lead-handoff event. This matches the intended separation between ordinary relay and delegated Task execution.

These are source/route/UI findings. No second-provider native Conversation, Resource materialization, rendered producer-label flow, or A→B→A USER journey was executed. Feature 004 is ACCEPTED/LOCKED (2026-11-09); none of these behaviors is implemented by acceptance.

## Alternatives

- Wait for full multi-provider parity before any slice. Rejected: the release contract asks for one qualified flow per area.
- Generate a complete schema inside this package. Rejected: machine contracts live in `docs/schemas/` and the owner doc.

## Limitations

- Rival web pages were not re-fetched on 2026-11-06 for this package; use [COMPETITIVE-RESEARCH.md](../../docs/COMPETITIVE-RESEARCH.md) before a future market-positioning decision.
- No second-provider native Conversation, Resource materialization, rendered producer-label flow or A→B→A USER journey was executed.

## Implementation efficiency and language-placement observations (2026-11-09)

Source-grounded notes for the implementer; each is folded into the task named and none changes a locked decision.

- **Provider dispatch should be a closed enum (Rust).** Adding Claude Code as a second string arm in `execute_agent_turn` would repeat the `OPENCODE`/`opencode` mismatch. Use Feature 002's `NativeProviderKey` and give each arm its own function (`run_opencode_turn`, `run_claude_code_turn`) instead of growing the 250-line inline match (004-T05).
- **Per-turn host spawn.** The OpenCode arm spawns a full `opencode serve` process for every turn (`hosting_mode: LOCAL_PER_SESSION`). That satisfies fresh-session-per-turn but costs a server start each turn. SPEC §7 allows host reuse as a host-supervisor choice as long as the AgentSession and native session are new per turn; a warm per-incarnation host is a Feature 001 host-supervisor optimization, measured before adoption. Claude Code's non-interactive mode is a per-invocation process by nature, so no host pool is proposed for it (004-T05 note only).
- **Producer identity belongs in the typed parse (TypeScript).** The Tauri bridge forwards `serde_json::Value`, so no Rust change is needed to preserve producer fields; the fix is in `parseConversationSnapshot`. Validating the two fields there (bounded id or null) keeps one parser as the trust boundary (004-T02).
- **Picker gating should consume a daemon projection.** `deriveConversationAgentSurface` reimplements descriptor/auth checks in TypeScript without a production caller. The daemon should report per-binding dispatchability and freshness (Feature 002 descriptor projection) and the picker should only render it (004-T06).
- **Portable export ordering.** The export is a pure function over a revision-ordered committed prefix; build it with one bounded indexed query capped at 1,024 messages rather than loading full history and trimming in memory (004-T03, AC-011).

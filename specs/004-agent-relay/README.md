# 004 - Agent Relay on One Conversation

**Status:** ACCEPTED/LOCKED - owner-accepted 2026-11-09; authorizes implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.
**Revision:** 1.0 | **Updated:** 2026-11-11
**Implementation state (2026-11-11):** Partial CODE only. Desktop message parsing/rendering preserves producer binding/session identity; the picker filters providers with no dispatch arm. Portable context carries producer identity, bounds history, excludes SYSTEM_NOTICE/native handles, and has an A→B→A storage regression test. Feature 001 also materializes eligible text ResourceRefs at dispatch; binary/root resources and Feature 004's adapter-budget/truncation receipt remain open. There is no qualified second provider, fresh descriptor/auth readiness gate, SQLite-to-desktop A→B→A journey, or recovery qualification. See TASKS.md and docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md.
**Owners:** Conversation, Agent Runtime, Product. Accepted by the repository owner via [docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md](../../docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md).

## User outcome

On one Conversation the owner runs a committed turn on agent A, a later turn on agent B that sees only portable context, then returns to A without copying private transcripts or credentials.

## Current truth

The active checkout contains the Rust daemon, Tauri desktop application and shared crates. B-15 and B-16 are owner-accepted (2026-11-09) and implementation is authorized. Today the supervisor has one dispatch arm (OpenCode), no Claude Code arm, and the desktop retains producer identity in `parseConversationSnapshot` and renders it on committed AGENT messages; a portable-context unit test now proves A→B→A producer attribution and excludes native session handles. There is still no selectable, qualified A→B→A provider pair (SPEC §4). The implementation boundary is mapped in docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md; do not infer qualification from a matching route, type or screen.

## Lifecycle, scope and dependencies

- Lifecycle: ACCEPTED/LOCKED (2026-11-09). IMPLEMENTING when the first TASKS.md task starts; VERIFIED only through the final task with owner sign-off.
- Relay pair: agent A OpenCode v2.0.32, agent B Claude Code CLI. Release matrix: Windows x64 first, Linux x64 second.
- Depends on [Feature 001](../001-conversation-session-supervisor/SPEC.md) (turn admission, settlement, recovery), [Feature 002](../002-native-agent-install-auth-binding/SPEC.md) (OpenCode binding fix, descriptor, Claude Code module) and [Feature 003](../003-workspace-roots-context-ingestion/SPEC.md) (Resource materialization). Delivery wave 4 (gate E).

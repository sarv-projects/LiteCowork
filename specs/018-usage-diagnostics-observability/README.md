# 018 - Usage, Diagnostics and Observability

- **Status:** IN_REVIEW - authored 2026-11-09 after the owner acceptance packet; B-42 is PROPOSED and pending owner review; does not authorize implementation and is not a claim of implementation or qualification.
- **Revision:** 0.1 | **Updated:** 2026-11-09 | **Delivery wave:** Wave 6 (gate G); normalization contract needed in Wave 1 by Feature 001 | **Master plan:** P11
- **Owners:** Observability, Operator/API, Desktop UI, Security/Trust, Agent Runtime and Product.

## User outcome

The owner opens Settings > Usage & Monitoring and sees honest, source-labelled usage per Workspace, Conversation, agent and day, with unknown and estimated values separated and no fabricated `$0.00`, `0 tokens` or `100%`. In Settings > About & Diagnostics the owner sees real build information, health probes, redacted logs and local crash records, and can write a previewed, allowlisted support bundle to a local file. Nothing is uploaded.

## Current truth

No usage record exists in any Rust source; the OpenCode adapter parses no token field; usage routes are target-only. The quota observation route is served and always returns `null`. Daemon diagnostics are 12 `eprintln!` calls; there is no structured log, crash record or support bundle. Settings has four categories and neither Usage nor About. See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) section 4.

# UI behavior - Native Agent Install, Auth and Binding

**Status:** ACCEPTED/LOCKED - owner-accepted 2026-11-09; authorizes implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.

Screen ownership (A-35, accepted): the Settings -> Agents screen, its layout and its normative control table belong to [Feature 011](../../011-desktop-shell-ipc-settings-runtime/SPEC.md). This file specifies only the behavior of the 002 operations that screen and the composer invoke.

Behavior, not pixels. The Settings shell, global control authority and per-control mutation/failure classes are owned by [V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT.md](../../../docs/V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT.md), [V1-SETTINGS-CONTRACT-LEDGER.md](../../../docs/V1-SETTINGS-CONTRACT-LEDGER.md), [DESKTOP-SHELL-LLD.md](../../../docs/DESKTOP-SHELL-LLD.md), and the [V1 Agent Discovery LLD](../../../docs/V1-AGENT-DISCOVERY-AND-CATALOG-LLD.md). This package owns agent-specific lifecycle and profile details.

## Settings > Agents screens

The category contains Catalog, Installed, Profiles, Workspace bindings and a Usage shortcut. Do not add a global Providers page or global model picker. The screen keeps the Settings category navigation persistent and a focused main panel with search and status filters.

### Catalog
Cards/list rows contain reviewed local logo or neutral fallback, display name/purpose, source/license, OS/Runtime compatibility, detection, installation/version, configuration, authentication, readiness, supported protocol/surfaces, last-used only when observed, and context-sensitive action. Search and filters are projections; they never change lifecycle state. Registry metadata must not supply executable commands or trusted install authority.

### Agent profile detail
Sections:
- Overview: module/vendor/source/license, exact version, OS/Runtime incarnation, redacted install origin, protocol/capabilities, independent status axes, last verified/used and repair reasons.
- Installation: versions, source/channel, digest/signature, disk impact, install/update/repair operation history; preview then confirm; rollback/uninstall only for lifecycle-owned binaries with qualified semantics.
- Authentication: native sign-in method kind and redacted state; descriptor-declared secure slots brokered to OS SecretStore; no credential value in WebView, storage events or logs.
- Capabilities: descriptor-driven supported/unsupported/unknown/not exposed matrix.
- Workspace bindings: disabled-by-default create, versioned enable/disable, lead eligibility/default, descriptor-specific model/effort/mode defaults. Binding is not installation/authentication/permission to invoke or proof of active session.
- Diagnostics: bounded redacted probe timeline and actionable typed repair reason.

### Independent state axes
Detection: NOT_SCANNED, SCANNING, DETECTED, NOT_DETECTED, STALE, ERROR.
Installation: MISSING, INSTALLING, INSTALLED, UPDATE_AVAILABLE, UPDATING, VERSION_UNAVAILABLE, BROKEN.
Configuration: UNCONFIGURED, PARTIAL, CONFIGURED, INVALID, UNKNOWN.
Authentication: NOT_REQUIRED, SIGN_IN_REQUIRED, AUTHENTICATING, AUTHENTICATED, EXPIRED, DENIED, UNKNOWN.
Readiness: NOT_TESTED, CHECKING, READY, DEGRADED, UNAVAILABLE, INCOMPATIBLE.

The card summary is derived. Ready requires exact module/version + Runtime incarnation + config/auth + current descriptor + qualified readiness proof. Installed is not authenticated; authenticated is not bound; bound is not granted; enabled is not session-ready.

## Actions and behavior

| Action | Preconditions | UI result |
|---|---|---|
| Search/filter | catalogue projection | local filtered projection, preserve query |
| Refresh catalog | registry read | update timestamp; retain stale cached snapshot on offline |
| Refresh detection | qualified Runtime module | per-card fresh observation; one slow probe does not block others |
| Details | profile/catalog read | full details, unknown fields explicitly unknown |
| Add existing | native picker + module exact-path validation | save only validated profile; never accept shell command |
| Preview install/update/repair | trusted module plan for OS/arch | show source, version, digest/signature, license, bytes, disk impact |
| Confirm install/update/repair | accepted preview + idempotency + lifecycle owner | operation status/receipt and post-install health probe; no implicit binding |
| Select version/rollback | lifecycle owns both versions and rollback | version history; preserve user-owned native config |
| Uninstall | explicit impact confirmation, no active claims | remove only LiteCowork-owned exact installation |
| Open native config | module-known target and fresh descriptor | open exact native target; never accept caller path |
| Sign in | supported native auth method | launch official flow; cancellation does not change prior binding |
| Add secure key | fresh descriptor declares slot + OS broker | secret submitted once, cleared from UI, never returned |
| Test auth/readiness | module defines safe probe and cost | actual probe result/source/time; disclose billable probe if applicable |
| Create binding | profile and Workspace exist | disabled binding; does not start session |
| Enable/disable binding | current version and descriptor checks | receipt; affects future admission only |
| Set default lead | enabled + lead-eligible binding | Workspace CAS; no silent alternate fallback |
| Set model/effort/mode | fresh descriptor options | future admission/new sessions; stale choice rejected, draft preserved |
| Remove binding | ownership + active Attempt impact review | binding disabled/removed; no binary uninstall |
| Usage shortcut | Usage read projection | open Usage with binding filter; unknown coverage remains explicit |

## Current implementation crosswalk (not the target)

The current desktop surface is `AgentCatalogSettings`:
- 15 curated local candidates are separate from remote ACP Registry distributions.
- Local installation/version inventory is bounded and version-only; authentication is UNKNOWN and session readiness NOT_PROBED.
- Explicit profile probe is limited to Codex and OpenCode and requires enrolled local Runtime.
- Codex App Server observations exist; OpenCode probe records incompatible offer/capabilities false.
- Observed profiles show Runtime-offer compatibility/readiness, expiry, diagnostics and Workspace binding state.
- Workspace bindings can be created disabled and enabled/disabled through versioned actions; Workspace default lead and worker-profile controls exist.
- Descriptor panel reads and refreshes through served routes and ID-only Tauri commands. No V1 AgentModule currently provides a qualified descriptor, so the active profiles fail closed with 503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE.
- No install/update action or usage projection is served here; Install and Update are shown as unavailable in V1. Sign-in and native-config routes are served but fail closed (see the trace below).

Source/UI mismatches:
- OpenCode is blocked from new binding by its incompatible profile offer even though Feature 001 contains an OpenCode dispatch path.
- Codex can be bound despite the current Conversation supervisor not dispatching Codex. A binding is not proof Send works.
- Backend enable currently checks a fresh compatible Runtime offer but not the AC-004 fresh AgentControlDescriptor.
- Credential submission validates then returns 503 (no durable replay receipt); auth-begin and native-config-open are served through authenticated ID-only Tauri commands but refuse every method or target because no V1 module declares one.
- ACP registry entries are metadata and do not become install or execution authority.

## Failure and accessibility contract

Empty, stale, offline, denied, unsupported OS, unsupported version, cancelled auth, auth expired, descriptor stale, profile conflict, missing executable and protocol mismatch are distinct. Preserve prior known-good profile/binding on failed refresh or auth. Use keyboard navigation, status text independent of color, screen-reader labels, high-contrast icons, reduced motion and responsive category/detail navigation. No inert clickable-looking controls.


## Provider-scoped model and effort picker

- The model picker is attached to one selected AgentProfile/AgentBinding/account; it is not global.
- Opening it shows the exact agent/provider identity, searchable descriptor-backed model list, selected option and provider-declared default marker.
- An Effort/Reasoning row appears only when the exact descriptor declares supported values for the selected model/profile. No generic effort enum is inferred.
- Provider-specific modes are separate and only appear when the adapter exposes them.
- The selected provider model identifier and descriptor revision are carried into the next admission. The adapter validates again. A change applies to future admissions/new sessions, not to an active Conversation/Attempt or provider-wide native config.
- On stale/unavailable descriptor or model removal, disable the stale choice, preserve the previous committed choice and current draft, and offer only a real refresh action.
- Task composer selection remains separate: choose Coworker/eligible AgentBinding first; model/effort selection is subordinate to that binding.
- Descriptor GET/refresh is wired through authenticated Tauri commands but returns fail-closed unavailable when no qualified AgentModule producer exists. Provider send routes remain unqualified. Therefore the model picker is a target design and must not be presented as active until the exact end-to-end path works.

## Cross-layer trace for every 002 user-visible operation (T14)

Chain: control -> Tauri command -> Operator route -> authorization -> service -> transaction/CAS -> record/event/receipt -> projection -> restart behavior -> evidence test. Every step names a symbol in source at the 2026-11-10 revision. A step that does not exist is stated as such; it is never inferred.

| Operation | Control (`AgentCatalogSettings` / `AgentControlDescriptorPanel`) | Tauri command (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) | Operator route and handler | Service and transaction | Record, receipt or projection | Restart behavior | Evidence test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Probe profile | "Probe OpenCode" / "Probe Codex" | `probe_agent_profile` | `POST /v1/agent-profiles/probe`, `probe_local_agent_profile` (`operator.rs`) | bounded `probe_opencode_profile` outside any transaction, then the profile/endpoint/offer write | `AgentProfile`, `AgentEndpoint`, RuntimeOffer (120 s expiry) | offer expires; probe is repeated | `opencode_profile`, `native_provider_key` (litecoworkd) |
| Create binding | "Create binding" | `create_agent_binding` | `POST /v1/agent-bindings`, `create_agent_binding` | `create_agent_binding_transaction` (fresh compatible offer gate) | disabled `AgentBinding` plus idempotency receipt | binding row is durable; offer must be fresh again to enable | `agent_binding_tests` (storage-sqlite) |
| Enable or disable binding | "Enable" / "Disable" | `enable_agent_binding`, `disable_agent_binding` | `enableAgentBinding` (`enable_agent_binding`), `disableAgentBinding` | `enable_agent_binding_transaction` with `X-Agent-Descriptor-Revision` CAS inside the same transaction | binding version, audit record, receipt | stale descriptor fails `RESOURCE_STALE` with no write | `enable_requires_the_current_fresh_descriptor_revision_when_the_module_declares_one` |
| Refresh descriptor | "Refresh controls" | `refresh_agent_control_descriptor` | `POST /v1/agent-profiles/{id}/refresh`, `refresh_control_descriptor` (`agent_control_operator.rs`) | `AgentDescriptorService::refresh` (budget 3 per minute, probe outside transaction, CAS append) | `agent_control_descriptors` row, digest | new RuntimeIncarnation never inherits a descriptor | `agent_lifecycle_recovery_restart_revalidates_the_descriptor_until_reprobed`, `agent_lifecycle_recovery_failed_probe_leaves_the_prior_descriptor_intact` |
| Sign in | "Sign in: <method>" rendered by `DescriptorSummary` only for a declared `NATIVE_FLOW` method | none yet (the control stays disabled because no `onBeginAuth` is supplied by the desktop build) | `POST /v1/agent-profiles/{id}/auth/{authMethodId}/begin`, `begin_agent_authentication` (`agent_auth_operator.rs`) | `AgentAuthService::begin` behind the `NativeLoginLauncher` boundary (V1: `UnqualifiedLauncher`) | in-memory `AuthObservation`, resealed into the next descriptor | observation is Runtime-local; a restart returns `UNKNOWN` | `agent_auth_*` (litecoworkd), `agent_auth_begin_*` route tests |
| Select model or effort | model popover view-model `deriveModelPicker` | none yet | `getAgentSessionOptions` is still target-only | none: no daemon admission consumes `{optionId, providerModelId, descriptorRevision}` yet | none | not applicable | `conversation-model-picker.test.ts` (view-model only) |
| Open native config | "Open native config: <target>" only for a declared target | none yet | `POST /v1/agent-profiles/{id}/native-config/{targetId}/open`, `open_native_configuration` (`agent_native_config_operator.rs`) | declared-target check, then `NativeConfigOpener` (V1: `UnqualifiedOpener`) | `NativeConfigOpenReceipt` | stateless | `native_config_open_rejects_undeclared_targets_and_caller_paths` |

Breaks found by this trace, left open in the owning task: (1) Sign in and Open native config now have authenticated ID-only Tauri commands and descriptor-driven UI controls (T07, T10); the model picker still has no Tauri command because its options route is target-only (T09); (2) `getAgentSessionOptions` and `getAgentHarnessCapabilities` are still target-only (T05, T09); (3) no qualified launcher or opener exists, so the served routes refuse every declared method (T07, T10). The native action controls remain unavailable for current V1 modules because no auth method or native-config target is declared and the daemon launcher/opener fail closed.

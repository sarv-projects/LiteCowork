# Research - Native Agent Install, Auth, Binding and Agent Profile UX

**Feature:** 002 | **Checked:** 2026-11-06 (active source/UI audit and screenshot/competitor comparison; no native install or provider session executed). Re-traced 2026-11-09 for the OpenCode binding break (SPEC §4a).

**Status:** ACCEPTED/LOCKED - owner-accepted 2026-11-09; authorizes implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.

## Primary authority
Canonical design and state ownership: docs/AGENT-CONTROL.md, docs/AGENT-FABRIC.md, docs/V1-AGENT-DISCOVERY-AND-CATALOG-LLD.md, docs/V1-SETTINGS-CONTRACT-LEDGER.md, docs/V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT.md and root ARCHITECTURE.md. Feature 002 owns native AgentModule/profile/install/auth/binding boundaries. LiteSPM owns MCP/skill/plugin/capability-package lifecycle. Feature 001 owns Conversation admission/session execution. Feature 011 owns Settings shell/control authority. The agent catalogue LLD is normative target, not current implementation proof.

No DeepSeek Harness or ZCode code is imported; both are prototype/reference inputs. OpenBot (PolyForm Noncommercial) is cited below for model/effort-picker UX only and is explicitly reference/UX with no code reuse.

## External comparison and adoption
NeuralAgent public material describes a desktop workflow around discovering/using agents, configured/installed state, persistent agent work views, model routing, local voice, scheduling and computer-use. Its historic public repository describes a different Electron/React + Python/FastAPI architecture and plugin-like agent roles; current public product pages now describe a later computer-use product. Do not treat those web pages and the old code repository as one versioned implementation or copy either architecture wholesale. NeuralAgent's Settings screenshots are useful information-hierarchy references: persistent category navigation, installed vs available agents, notification preference, advanced runtime behavior and a separate cost/usage surface. Its Agents overview uses three summary filters (Needs You, Working, Done) and a grouped work list rather than separate permanent sidebar pages. Those counts/statuses must be real owner projections in LiteCowork.

Adopt:
- agent catalogue and agent profile are separate levels;
- installed/detected/configured/authenticated/ready are independent axes;
- installed and available distributions are separate sections with source, version, compatibility and action;
- status groups such as Needs You / Working / Done are filters over durable Work/Task states, not independent navigation routes;
- notification preferences are separate from work state and reflect the real notification delivery/attention queue;
- advanced controls distinguish local preference from native process/runtime behavior and show restart/recovery semantics;
- Usage is a first-class read-only observability surface, drillable by actual agent/model/session/Task with confidence/coverage.

Reject:
- a single Connected toggle;
- treating a registry listing as a safe install command;
- a global model/provider selector that overrides an agent's native model/auth contract;
- a top-level Working list that duplicates Work/Task or Conversation state;
- usage totals inferred from screenshots, flat-plan token guesses or assumed API list price;
- visual statuses for process, resume, keep-awake or notifications without owner service/OS observation.

## Screenshot-specific UI interpretation
1. Settings Agents: default agent selection is native-harness-owned and applies only to new work; installed versions are listed with exact executable/version and external official link; available candidates show install action only when a trusted install plan exists.
2. Notifications: explicit choices combine sound and OS notification delivery (both, sound only, notification only, neither), with quiet/in-focus behavior; a 'Try it' control is a real local preview that does not send a notification to another device.
3. Advanced: keep-awake choices are OS power assertions with distinct battery/power semantics; resume-after-restart is a scheduler/recovery policy for admitted agent jobs, not a promise that arbitrary external native sessions can be restored.
4. Agents overview: 3 status summary tiles are filters, not left-sidebar routes. LiteCowork's primary sidebar remains Conversations, Coworker roster, Work, Needs You, Automations, Library, Discover and Settings; Agents work should be accessible as a Work filter/overview, not a duplicate global task engine.
5. Usage: dashboard quick ranges Today, 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year and All time, plus YTD/Custom in expanded filters. Grouping and filters are governed by telemetry LLD and existing ledgers.
6. Work panels: keep separate Conversations and native Terminal panes within a Task/work context only when actual session/process identity exists; do not promote mock terminal output to durable completed work.

## Current LiteCowork source/UI evidence
- `AgentCatalogSettings` currently lists 15 curated candidates and ACP registry entries; registry results are read-only and map to NO_ADAPTER.
- Local inventory probes version/path metadata for a bounded candidate set; auth UNKNOWN, readiness NOT_PROBED. No actual AgentModule install/update action exists.
- Profile probe supports Codex/OpenCode only, Runtime enrollment required. Codex App Server initialize/account/model-list is observed; OpenCode is recorded incompatible. Neither guarantees an end-to-end Conversation session.
- Descriptor read/refresh and credential submission return 503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE; auth-begin and native-config-open are served and wired through authenticated ID-only Tauri commands, but fail closed because no V1 module declares a qualified method or target.
- Binding list/create/enable/disable/default actions are served; enable currently lacks required fresh AgentControlDescriptor gate.
- Conversation supervisor dispatches OpenCode only, but current OpenCode profile probe is incompatible; Codex can be bound but is not dispatched by the active supervisor.
- UI currently has no Install/Update or native sign-in flow; usage detail/projection is not served.

## V1 boundary
Deliver one complete exact native agent journey first. Other agents may be listed as detected/available/unsupported but must not be presented as runnable until their install/auth/descriptor/session contract is independently qualified on a declared OS/Runtime. Do not use catalog breadth as a V1 acceptance metric.


## OpenBot model/effort picker comparison — 2026-11-06

Pinned source: nightly-labs/openbot@6759fa3ee857f4f4966865e12de99ae84ab6de07 (package 0.62.0). The shared AgentSettingsPanel and ProviderModelPicker show a compact, searchable model list attached to one selected agent/profile/account, with a selected marker and an optional effort row. Provider runtime adapters supply model catalog and account-specific details; this is not a global model router.

Adopt the compact interaction hierarchy only: agent/profile identity, searchable exact-provider model list, selected/default marker, and effort only when the exact descriptor supports it. Keep provider-specific modes outside the generic model list. The model control is distinct from the Task agent/Coworker selector. Do not mix model options from different providers/accounts.

The OpenBot package declares PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 and its README describes a development preview with danger-full-access / approvalPolicy never. No code or permission model is reused. Full source pin and limitations: [OPENBOT-REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATION-STUDY.md](../../docs/OPENBOT-REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATION-STUDY.md).

LiteCowork's model/effort picker remains target-only until fresh AgentControlDescriptor read/refresh, adapter compatibility, account scope, and an exact native Conversation/Task send path are all qualified. Existing discovery/profile/binding evidence does not establish that a selected model is dispatchable.


## Claude Code CLI as the second module (B-11, accepted 2026-11-09)

The inventory already lists a `CLAUDE_CODE` candidate (`agent_id: "claude-code"`, executable `claude`) in `apps/litecoworkd/src/agents/native_cli.rs`. That is version/path detection only. There is no Claude Code profile probe, descriptor, auth observation or supervisor dispatch arm. 002-T12 pins the exact CLI version, the non-interactive streaming transport and the native auth method in a conformance fixture by running the installed CLI and reading its own help/version output on each release-matrix OS; it does not infer flags from third-party listings. The dispatch arm itself is Feature 004 (B-16).

## Implementation efficiency and language-placement observations (2026-11-09)

These are source-grounded observations recorded for the implementer. Each is folded into the task named; none changes a locked decision.

- **Stringly-typed provider dispatch (Rust).** `execute_agent_turn` matches `provider_key` string literals, which is how the `OPENCODE`/`opencode` mismatch went unnoticed. A closed `NativeProviderKey` enum parsed once removes the class of bug (002-T01).
- **Duplicate executable resolution (Rust).** `resolve_local_executable` in `operator.rs` and `find_opencode_executable` in `agents/supervisor.rs` implement different search rules for the same binary. One resolver in `apps/litecoworkd/src/agents/` plus dispatch from the probe-registered `endpoint_ref` gives one identity and avoids a second PATH walk per turn (002-T01).
- **Profile lookup by full scan (Rust).** The supervisor calls `list_agent_profiles` and then searches linearly for one `agent_profile_id` on every turn. A keyed `get_agent_profile` read is cheaper and narrower (002-T01, shared file with Feature 004).
- **Descriptor rules duplicated across Rust and TypeScript.** `apps/litecoworkd/src/agents/control_descriptor.rs` validates descriptors in Rust, while `apps/litecowork-ui/src/conversations/conversation-agent-surface.ts` re-derives readiness in TypeScript and has no production caller. The daemon should own the derivation and serve a projection; the TypeScript side should only parse and render, so freshness rules have one implementation (002-T05, 002-T09).
- **Generated constant types.** `operator-api.ts` encodes `profile_admission_supported: false` as a literal type. After the OpenAPI change the file must be regenerated with `pnpm --dir apps/litecowork-ui run api:generate` and checked with `api:check`, not hand-edited (002-T01).
- **Large single files.** `apps/litecowork-ui/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (about 6,100 lines) holds the agent profile/binding Tauri commands inline (`probe_agent_profile`, `create_agent_binding`, `enable_agent_binding`), unlike the per-domain `*_bridge.rs` modules. `apps/litecoworkd/src/operator.rs` (about 9,500 lines) holds the agent probe handlers. New 002 commands go into `agent_control_bridge.rs` or a new `agent_binding_bridge.rs` rather than growing `lib.rs`; moving existing commands is optional and only with no behavior change (002-T05, 002-T10).
- **Per-probe server spawn.** Each OpenCode probe spawns and stops a server (8 s startup budget). That is correct for a bounded read-only probe; the B-12 probe budget (3 per minute) bounds the cost. No change proposed.

## ACP client SDK pin (P-11, owner approval 2026-11-09)

Task 002-T17 defines the native-agent adapter as an Agent Client Protocol (ACP) client (register A-54). The ACP SDK version and the exact protocol revision must be pinned here from the published ACP SDK at implementation time, not inferred from CLI output or a marketplace listing. Record: the SDK package name and exact version, the ACP protocol revision it implements, the per-provider launch catalog entries (command, args, working-directory policy) for each enrolled provider, and the mapping from ACP `session/update` kinds to the internal normalizer events shared with Feature 001. The borrowable mapping and rationale are in [../../docs/REFERENCE-SYNTHESIS-AND-V1-FEATURE-ALIGNMENT-2026-11.md](../../docs/REFERENCE-SYNTHESIS-AND-V1-FEATURE-ALIGNMENT-2026-11.md) section 1 and register row A-54 in [../../docs/CONTRADICTION-AND-ALIGNMENT-REGISTER.md](../../docs/CONTRADICTION-AND-ALIGNMENT-REGISTER.md); they are not restated here. Pin status until the published SDK is fetched on the implementation host: TARGET-pending-published-ACP-SDK.

## DeepSeek Harness proposals (PROPOSED, owner review required)

Research note, not a decision. Source: [deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/tree/fcc0ad462172522aaf5c93a7b2e01f6b9f0b0159) at the pinned SHA (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 DeepSeek). Local read-only clone `repo_take/deepseek-harness` is gitignored and never staged. Upstream paths below were checked to exist at that SHA on 2026-11-10.

Read-depth limits from the study (do not over-trust): `scripts/` about 58% read, tests about 5% read, installer UI text partly unread. See [desktop study](../../docs/DEEPSEEK-HARNESS-DESKTOP-DEEP-DIVE-2026-11.md) Sections 0 and 15 before turning any item into a design.

- **P-38 Login-shell PATH-class capture for agents launched from a Linux desktop entry.** Class **OWNER (open; not ADOPT, ADAPT or REJECT yet)**. Upstream: [src/login-shell-environment.ts](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/fcc0ad462172522aaf5c93a7b2e01f6b9f0b0159/apps/desktop/src/login-shell-environment.ts). Study: [desktop study](../../docs/DEEPSEEK-HARNESS-DESKTOP-DEEP-DIVE-2026-11.md) Section 14 (row P-38 and the conflict note). Lesson: CONFLICT, stays open: capturing the login-shell environment merges ambient variables over the inherited environment, which conflicts with environment scrubbing (A-58, Section 9 of the desktop study and the Env scrubbing lesson in the plugin study) and with the T07 and T13 environment rules of package 002. Only a PATH-class allowlist could be considered, and only after an owner decision. Reuse: Pattern only, reimplement. No upstream code or text is copied or imported (AGENTS.md section 7; upstream is Electron and TypeScript, LiteCowork is Tauri, Rust and React). No reuse is allowed before the owner decision. Where it applies: T07 and T13 of package 002; package 005 Environment admission. Deferral: Blocked on the owner decision. Then a Linux desktop-entry launch test. **Open conflict with environment scrubbing (A-58); owner decision required.**

Plugin-architecture lessons (see [plugin study](../../docs/DEEPSEEK-HARNESS-PLUGIN-ARCHITECTURE-DEEP-DIVE-2026-11.md) Section 8):
  - Pre-flight compatibility read, keep the working version (Agent Upgrade Shield, P-21): [packages/boot/plugin-manager/src/operations.ts](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/fcc0ad462172522aaf5c93a7b2e01f6b9f0b0159/packages/boot/plugin-manager/src/operations.ts). Class **ADAPT**. Read the new agent version facts before replacing a working install. Reuse: pattern only, reimplement; no upstream code imported.
  - Capability seam: Definition, Provider, Consumer (ADR P-20): [docs/capability-seams.md](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/fcc0ad462172522aaf5c93a7b2e01f6b9f0b0159/docs/capability-seams.md). Class **ADAPT**. Applies to the agent install and auth binding seam; ADR is proposed, not accepted. Reuse: pattern only, reimplement; no upstream code imported.
  - Env scrubbing by execution mode (relevant to the open P-38 conflict): [packages/boot/plugin-manager/src/operations.ts](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/fcc0ad462172522aaf5c93a7b2e01f6b9f0b0159/packages/boot/plugin-manager/src/operations.ts). Class **ADAPT**. A captured subprocess uses a scrubbed parent environment; only an interactive CLI run inherits the real one. Reuse: pattern only, reimplement; no upstream code imported.


## Windows host CLI observation (2026-11-11, local evidence)

Commands: `claude --version`, `claude --help`, and `claude auth --help`; all exited 0. The installed version is `2.1.310 (Claude Code)`. Its help describes interactive mode by default and `--print` for non-interactive output; input/output formats include `stream-json`, with optional partial-message chunks. It lists `auth login`, `auth logout`, and `auth status`; it does not establish the underlying native auth method or credential validity. For background sessions it documents a session ID and `claude stop|kill`; no foreground cancellation guarantee was found. No prompt was submitted, no sign-in was started, and no credentials or account details were read. This advances T12 from “CLI unavailable” to local advertised-transport evidence only; an actual redacted stream fixture and safe-stop/auth verification remain mandatory.

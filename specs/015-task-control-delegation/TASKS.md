# Tasks - Task Control and Heterogeneous Delegation

**Feature:** 015 | **Status:** IN_REVIEW - authored complete for owner review; implementation not authorized until owner acceptance (T01); tasks not started unless marked.
**Spec revision:** 0.1 | **Release target:** V1 (release matrix rows: Windows x64 + OpenCode v2.0.32 first; Linux x64 second). For this package the Linux x64 row qualifies first because Task execution needs an attested Environment (B-17 rider); the Windows row stays UNAVAILABLE until Feature 005 B-35 qualifies.
**Owners:** Task Runtime, Delegation, Storage, Operator/API, Desktop UI, Security/Trust, Product.

Cross-package task references inside task fields are written as "Feature NNN Txx" so that each hyphenated cross-package ID appears once in this file (the structural validator rejects a repeated task ID); the hyphenated IDs are listed once in "Cross-package dependencies" below.

## Current baseline

Verified against the checkout on branch `docs/audit-competitor-superset`; highest migration `docs/schemas/sqlite-v28.sql`.

- **Domain (Rust, CODE, no production caller):** `crates/domain-task/src/delegation_admission.rs` (`decide_child_attempt_admission`, `decide_child_attempt_admission_from_durable_snapshot`, `preview_child_attempt_admission`, `ChildAdmissionDenial` with 15 variants including `ProfileNotEnabledForCoworker`); `crates/domain-task/src/execution.rs` (`StepAttemptCoordinator::preview_delegated_admission`, `admit`); `crates/domain-task/src/lead_failover.rs` (`FailoverPolicy`, `decide_lead_failover`), `lead_failover_service.rs` (`LeadFailoverService::evaluate`), `lead_handoff_packet.rs` (`prepare_lead_handoff_packet`); `crates/domain-task/src/delegation_recovery.rs` (`EscalationPolicy { max_worker_attempts, fallback_profile_ids }`, no `on_exhaustion`, register A-37); `crates/domain-task/src/delegation_result_service.rs`.
- **Served:** `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/lead-agent` (`owner_handoff` in `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_lead_handoff_operator.rs`) commits only the lead-binding CAS, `task.lead_agent.changed.v1` and the receipt through `TaskStore::commit_task_lead_handoff`; it creates no Attempt and fences nothing. `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/verification-runs` (`list_task_verification_runs` in `apps/litecoworkd/src/verification_runs_operator.rs`) is read-only; `start_verification_run` and `settle_verification_run` in `crates/storage-sqlite/src/verification_runs.rs` have no route. Delegation profile routes in `apps/litecoworkd/src/delegation_profiles_operator.rs`.
- **Storage:** Task status is a `String`; `AttemptState` is typed in `crates/storage-core/src/execution.rs`; `execution_leases.epoch` with `UNIQUE(step_id, epoch)`; `task_spec_revisions.parent_revisions_json`; `coworker_revisions.enabled_delegation_profile_ids_json` read by the SQLite child-admission guard in `crates/storage-sqlite/src/execution.rs`; `delegation_results` (`sqlite-v24.sql`). No ResumePacket or control-request storage.
- **Errors present:** `TASK_ALREADY_PAUSED`, `TASK_PAUSE_UNSAFE`, `TASK_TERMINAL`, `DELEGATION_DEPTH_EXCEEDED`, `DELEGATION_CONCURRENCY_EXCEEDED`, `DELEGATION_PROFILE_DISABLED`, `DELEGATION_PROFILE_ARCHIVED`, `STALE_FENCE`. Absent: a wire code for the Coworker allowlist denial, budget exhaustion, sharing denial, `TASK_NOT_PAUSED`.
- **UI:** `WorkPage`, `TaskListPanel`, `TaskDetailPanel` in `apps/litecowork-ui/src/App.tsx`; `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/` (`TaskSpecRevisionHistory.tsx`, `task-stream.ts`, `planning-readiness.ts`); `apps/litecowork-ui/src/presentation/TaskPresentationPanel.tsx`. No timeline, Workers view or control buttons. No Tauri bridge for handoff, verification runs, pause, resume or steer.

Gaps to V1: no owner acceptance (B-39), no typed Task status, no pause/resume/steer, no child-Attempt dispatch, no late-result fence, no independent verifier, no Work-screen controls or timeline, and no CODE/SYSTEM/USER evidence on either row. Everything that executes depends on the Feature 005 Attempt admission and Linux Environment.

## 015-T01 - Owner acceptance of SPEC and blockers

- **Status:** BLOCKED - pending owner acceptance of this SPEC revision 0.1 and blocker B-39 (owner: repository owner, sarv-projects; Delegation and Product prepare the decision).
- **Depends on:** NONE
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 accepted (done 2026-11-09); Feature 005 B-35 decision is separate and does not block acceptance of this package.
- **Owner:** Product, Delegation; decision by the repository owner.
- **Allowed paths:** `specs/015-task-control-delegation/` (status flip to ACCEPTED/LOCKED per the authoring brief section 2). Register rows are written by the orchestrator.
- **Contract:** SPEC sections 5 and 17; AC-021; SPECIFICATION-STANDARD section 7.
- **Change intent:** record the owner decision on B-39 (pair, Environment sharing, V1 bounds, A-37 default); flip SPEC and WIRING status to ACCEPTED/LOCKED, bump revision to 1.0, add the owner-acceptance metadata line, rename "PROPOSED" signature headings to "Accepted target".
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Owner decision on B-39 recorded with date and any rider.
  - [ ] SPEC, WIRING, README, PLAN, DATA-MODEL, RESEARCH and contracts banners updated together; validator PASS.
  - [ ] Negative: no task below starts implementation while this task is BLOCKED.
- **Command:** `python3 .specify/scripts/validate_feature_package.py`
- **Evidence:** owner decision reference in SPEC section 5; register row for B-39 closed by the orchestrator.
- **Stop:** owner rejects or changes B-39; revise SPEC and re-run review before any other task.

## 015-T02 - Promote accepted interfaces into owner docs and machine schemas

- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Depends on:** T01
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 contract promotion (its T01) merged first so Attempt, cancel and Environment names are canonical.
- **Owner:** Task Runtime, Delegation, API, Events, Storage owners.
- **Allowed paths:** `docs/TASK-RUNTIME.md`, `docs/DELEGATION.md`, `docs/STATE-MACHINES.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/EVENTS.md`, `docs/STORAGE.md`, `docs/SCHEMAS.md`, `docs/schemas/operator-api.openapi.yaml`, `docs/schemas/error-codes.schema.json`, `docs/schemas/domain-event.schema.json`, `docs/schemas/delegation.schema.json`, `docs/schemas/sqlite-v29.sql` (new; use the next free number at implementation time), this package.
- **Contract:** SPEC sections 7.2, 8; AC-002, AC-009, AC-011; register A-37.
- **Change intent:** in one reviewed change promote routes `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/pause`, `/resume`, `/steering`, `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/activity`, `/workers`; errors `DELEGATION_PROFILE_NOT_ENABLED_FOR_COWORKER`, `DELEGATION_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, `DELEGATION_ENVIRONMENT_SHARING_DENIED`, `TASK_NOT_PAUSED`, `HANDOFF_PRIOR_LEASE_ACTIVE`; events `task.pause.requested.v1`, `task.paused.v1`, `task.resumed.v1`, `task.steering.recorded.v1`, `task.child_attempt.admitted.v1`, `task.child_result.fenced.v1`; tables `task_control_requests` and `task_resume_packets`; remove the "TARGET, not yet wired" label from `escalation_policy.on_exhaustion` in owner prose and schema description together (A-37). Each item is labelled "accepted target interface (not yet in source)" until its implementing task lands.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Every promoted name exists once in its owner doc and machine schema; no parallel definition in this package.
  - [ ] Migration is the next immutable `sqlite-vNN.sql`; older migrations byte-identical; fingerprint test passes.
  - [ ] Negative: schema validation rejects a pause body without `expected_task_version` and a steering body over 16 KiB.
- **Command:** `python3 .specify/scripts/validate_feature_package.py` and `python3 scripts/validate_architecture.py` and `cargo test -p storage-sqlite --locked schema`
- **Evidence:** PR link and command output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** a promoted name conflicts with an existing owner definition; resolve at the owner.

## 015-T03 - Typed TaskStatus enum and transition table (Rust)

- **Status:** NOT STARTED - Task status is a `String` in `TaskRecord`/`TaskView`; transitions are checked ad hoc (for example the `"READY" | "RUNNING"` safe boundary in `lead_failover_service.rs`).
- **Depends on:** T01, T02
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** coordinate with Feature 005 (its Attempt admission task) so both use the same enum.
- **Owner:** Task Runtime, Storage.
- **Allowed paths:** `crates/storage-core/src/task_status.rs` (new), `crates/storage-core/src/lib.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/lib.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/lead_failover_service.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/lib.rs` (status parse/serialize only), adjacent tests.
- **Contract:** SPEC section 7.2; STATE-MACHINES "Task"; AC-002, AC-003, AC-013.
- **Change intent:** add `TaskStatus` (13 states, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE serde) and `task_transition(from, &TaskControlCommand)`, generated as an exhaustive match so a missing transition is a compile error; replace string comparisons in domain-task with the enum; keep the stored column text-compatible (no migration).
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Table test covers every (state, command) pair against STATE-MACHINES, including PAUSED to CANCEL_REQUESTED and no VERIFYING to RUNNING.
  - [ ] Unknown stored status fails closed with a typed error, never defaults.
  - [ ] Existing lead-failover tests still pass.
- **Command:** `cargo test -p storage-core --locked task_status` and `cargo test -p domain-task --locked` (filter `task_status` to be added by this task)
- **Evidence:** test output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** the stored data contains a status not in STATE-MACHINES; fix at the owner first.

## 015-T04 - Pause and resume: storage, domain and quiescence

- **Status:** NOT STARTED - no `request_pause`/`resume` in source; error codes exist.
- **Depends on:** T01, T03
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T08 (Attempt admission service) and Feature 005 T11 (single-Attempt cancel and quiescence primitive).
- **Owner:** Task Runtime, Storage.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_control_service.rs` (new), `crates/domain-task/src/task_control.rs` (new), `crates/domain-task/src/lib.rs`, `crates/storage-core/src/lib.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/task_control.rs` (new), `crates/storage-sqlite/src/task_control_tests.rs` (new).
- **Contract:** SPEC L-01, L-02, sections 7.2, 11; TASK-RUNTIME "Pause and resume", "ResumePacket"; AC-001, AC-002, AC-003.
- **Change intent:** `TaskControlService::request_pause` commits PAUSE_REQUESTED plus a `task_control_requests` row and receipt; outside SQLite it asks each active Attempt (through the Feature 005 service) to stop at a safe boundary, waits for observed quiescence, builds the ResumePacket (fields per TASK-RUNTIME, no grants or leases), stores it in `task_resume_packets` with a digest, releases leases and commits PAUSED. `resume` commits the prior state, marks interrupted Attempts ABANDONED and leaves continuation to a fresh admission with a higher lease epoch. A response arriving during PAUSE_REQUESTED returns `CONFLICT`.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Pause from each allowed state reaches PAUSED only after quiescence and lease release (AC-001).
  - [ ] PAUSED, terminal, unsafe and stale inputs are rejected with the mapped code and no write; exact replay returns the stored receipt; same key with a different body is `CONFLICT` (AC-002).
  - [ ] Resume restores the prior state; a later admission uses epoch + 1; resume on a non-PAUSED Task is `TASK_NOT_PAUSED` (AC-003).
  - [ ] Fault injection after each insert rolls back the whole transaction.
- **Command:** `cargo test -p storage-sqlite --locked task_control` and `cargo test -p litecoworkd --locked task_control_pause` (filters to be added by this task)
- **Evidence:** test names and output in Completion evidence; IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS Task control row.
- **Stop:** any path reports PAUSED before quiescence is observed.

## 015-T05 - Typed steering with sibling spec revisions

- **Status:** NOT STARTED - `revise_saved_spec` in `crates/domain-task/src/lib.rs` revises a saved spec but has no steering class and is not admitted while the Task runs.
- **Depends on:** T01, T03
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** NONE
- **Owner:** Task Runtime, Storage.
- **Allowed paths:** `crates/domain-task/src/task_control.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/lib.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/task_control.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/lib.rs` (spec revision insert only), `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_control_service.rs`, adjacent tests.
- **Contract:** SPEC L-04, section 7.2 `SteerTaskRequest`; TASK-RUNTIME "Steering"; AC-004.
- **Change intent:** `steer(SteerTaskRequest)`: CHAT_ONLY records a steering note for the lead; TASK_SPEC_CHANGE inserts `TaskSpecRevision(n+1)` with `parent_revisions_json = [n]`; a concurrent change from the same base becomes a sibling; PLAN_HINT is delivered to the lead's next planning boundary; URGENT_INTERRUPT asks the active Attempt to stop at the next safe boundary; CANCEL delegates to T06. Running Attempts stay pinned; children receive only relevant changes or finish against their recorded revision with an applicability review flag.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Spec change creates n+1 and leaves the running Attempt's pinned revision unchanged (AC-004).
  - [ ] Two racing changes from revision n produce two siblings; neither is lost (AC-004).
  - [ ] Body over 16 KiB or unknown class is rejected; steering text never appears in logs.
- **Command:** `cargo test -p storage-sqlite --locked task_steering` (filter to be added by this task)
- **Evidence:** test output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** any implementation overwrites a revision.

## 015-T06 - Task-level cancel fan-out to child Attempts

- **Status:** NOT STARTED - Feature 005 plans a single-Attempt cancel; no fan-out exists.
- **Depends on:** T01, T03, T04
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T10 (`cancel_task` route and bridge) and Feature 005 T11 (cancel quiescence and Effect reconciliation).
- **Owner:** Task Runtime.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_control_service.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/task_control.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/task_control.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/execution.rs` (child Attempt listing only), adjacent tests.
- **Contract:** SPEC L-03, section 11; TASK-RUNTIME "Cancellation"; AC-005, AC-013.
- **Change intent:** extend the Feature 005 cancel path: on CANCEL_REQUESTED fence completion and new VerificationRuns, list every nonterminal child Attempt by `parent_attempt_id`, request cancel for each through the Feature 005 service, reconcile open Effects, and commit CANCELLED only when all are quiescent or settled. Cancel supersedes PAUSE_REQUESTED and is valid from PAUSED.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Cancel with two active children settles CANCELLED only after both are quiescent (AC-005).
  - [ ] Cancel during PAUSE_REQUESTED supersedes the pause; pause request outcome recorded as superseded (AC-005).
  - [ ] Pause and cancel racing: one CAS wins, the other gets `STALE_TASK_VERSION` (AC-013).
- **Command:** `cargo test -p litecoworkd --locked task_control_cancel_fanout` (filter to be added by this task)
- **Evidence:** test output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** a child is left RUNNING after the Task reports CANCELLED.

## 015-T07 - Handoff as an authorized new Attempt with late-result fencing

- **Status:** PARTIAL - `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/lead-agent` and `TaskLeadHandoffService::execute` commit the lead change (`apps/litecoworkd/src/task_lead_handoff_operator.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/lead_handoff.rs`, safe-boundary checks in `crates/storage-sqlite/src/lead_handoff_boundary.rs`); `prepare_lead_handoff_packet` exists. Missing: replacement Attempt, prior-lease wait, epoch fence on results.
- **Depends on:** T01, T03, T04
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T08 (Attempt admission with lease epoch).
- **Owner:** Task Runtime, Delegation, Storage.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/src/lead_handoff_attempt.rs` (new), `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_lead_handoff_operator.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/lead_handoff.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/lead_handoff_packet.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/delegation_result_service.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/delegation_results.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/execution.rs`, adjacent tests.
- **Contract:** SPEC L-05, L-13, section 7.2; release contract section 6 item 3; TASK-RUNTIME "Lead-agent change"; AC-006, AC-007.
- **Change intent:** after `commit_task_lead_handoff`, `start_replacement_lead_attempt` waits until the prior lease is released, expired or revoked (else `HANDOFF_PRIOR_LEASE_ACTIVE` with retry-after), then admits a new Attempt with epoch + 1 using the prepared handoff packet as context (no grants or handles). In `DelegationResultService` and the Effect-receipt path, compare child Attempt id, lease epoch and `revision_at_start` with current state; on mismatch write a `task.child_result.fenced.v1` observation and return `STALE_FENCE`.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Replacement Attempt has a new id and higher epoch; no grant, Approval, SecretLease or handle row is copied (AC-006).
  - [ ] A ResultEnvelope or Effect receipt from the old Attempt after replacement is fenced with no Task, Step, Effect or Artifact change (AC-007).
  - [ ] Two handoffs racing: one wins (AC-013).
- **Command:** `cargo test -p litecoworkd --locked lead_handoff_attempt` and `cargo test -p domain-task --locked delegation_result` (filters to be added by this task)
- **Evidence:** test output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** any late result mutates state.

## 015-T08 - Child-Attempt admission service with allowlist and B-39 Environment rule

- **Status:** PARTIAL - decision logic and SQLite guard exist (`crates/domain-task/src/delegation_admission.rs`, `StepAttemptCoordinator::preview_delegated_admission` and `admit` in `crates/domain-task/src/execution.rs`, guard in `crates/storage-sqlite/src/execution.rs`); no production caller in `apps/litecoworkd`, no wire code for `ProfileNotEnabledForCoworker`, no worker dispatch.
- **Depends on:** T01, T02, T03
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T04 (Linux bubblewrap provider) and Feature 005 T08 (Attempt admission); Feature 004 T05 (Claude Code dispatch arm); Feature 002 T12 (Claude Code AgentModule); Feature 009 Coworker revision with `enabled_delegation_profile_ids` editable.
- **Owner:** Delegation, Task Runtime, Storage.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/src/delegation_admission_service.rs` (new), `apps/litecoworkd/src/main.rs` (service wiring only), `crates/domain-task/src/delegation_admission.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/execution.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/task_packet_preparation.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/execution.rs`, adjacent tests.
- **Contract:** SPEC L-06 to L-08, B-39, sections 7.1, 7.2, 10; DELEGATION "Depth and concurrency"; AC-008, AC-009, AC-019.
- **Change intent:** `DelegationAdmissionService::admit_child` validates the delegate request came from the current parent session and lease (`ParentSessionProof`), loads the durable snapshot, calls `decide_child_attempt_admission_from_durable_snapshot`, enforces B-39 bounds (depth 1, concurrency 2) and `ATTEMPT_PRIVATE` sharing, and commits Attempt, Step binding, lease, budget reservation and `task.child_attempt.admitted.v1` in one transaction; only then asks the Feature 005 service to attach the Environment and start the worker session. Map each `ChildAdmissionDenial` variant to a wire code in one exhaustive function.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Allowed request commits all five records atomically before any Environment call (AC-008).
  - [ ] One negative test per `ChildAdmissionDenial` variant, each with no partial write (AC-009).
  - [ ] Non-current session, grant refs beyond the parent's, foreign Workspace and shared writable scope are denied; logs show ids and class only (AC-019).
  - [ ] Two admissions at the concurrency limit: one wins, the other gets `DELEGATION_CONCURRENCY_EXCEEDED` (AC-013).
- **Command:** `cargo test -p domain-task --locked delegation_admission` and `cargo test -p litecoworkd --locked delegation_admission_service` (second filter to be added by this task)
- **Evidence:** test output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** any path starts a worker before the admission commit.

## 015-T09 - Budgets and escalation with on_exhaustion (A-37)

- **Status:** PARTIAL - `EscalationPolicy` and `EscalationAttemptOutcome` exist in `crates/domain-task/src/delegation_recovery.rs`; `delegation_budget_policy_json` is read by the SQLite guard; no `on_exhaustion`, no threshold action executor.
- **Depends on:** T01, T02, T08
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 020 Needs You producer (for the NEEDS_YOU destination).
- **Owner:** Delegation.
- **Allowed paths:** `crates/domain-task/src/delegation_recovery.rs`, `crates/domain-task/src/delegation_envelopes.rs`, `apps/litecoworkd/src/delegation_admission_service.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/delegation_profiles.rs`, `crates/storage-sqlite/src/execution.rs`, adjacent tests.
- **Contract:** SPEC L-10, B-39 item 4, section 12; DELEGATION "Verification and escalation", "Cost, budgets, and performance projections"; AC-010, AC-011.
- **Change intent:** add `OnExhaustion { ReturnToLead, NeedsYou }` to `EscalationPolicy` with serde default `NeedsYou` for stored packets; `DelegationAdmissionService::escalate` admits the next fallback profile as a new Attempt only after the prior Attempt and its Effects settle; on exhaustion return a typed blocker to the lead or create a Needs You item. Budget evaluator resolves the strictest action across Attempt, Task and profile scopes.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Exhaustion with RETURN_TO_LEAD and with NEEDS_YOU each produce the right outcome; a legacy packet without the field reads as NEEDS_YOU (AC-011).
  - [ ] STOP_NEW_DELEGATION refuses new children with `DELEGATION_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`; out-of-range profile values are rejected, never clamped (AC-010).
- **Command:** `cargo test -p domain-task --locked delegation_recovery`
- **Evidence:** test output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** a replacement worker starts while the prior Attempt's Effect is AMBIGUOUS.

## 015-T10 - Independent-agent verification

- **Status:** PARTIAL - `start_verification_run`/`settle_verification_run` in `crates/storage-sqlite/src/verification_runs.rs` and `VerificationRunStatus` in `crates/domain-effects/src/lib.rs` exist; no producer and no independence rule.
- **Depends on:** T01, T08
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T09 (Effect reconciliation and independent file verifier).
- **Owner:** Task Runtime, Delegation.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/src/independent_verification_service.rs` (new), `crates/storage-sqlite/src/verification_runs.rs`, `crates/storage-core/src/verification_run.rs`, `crates/domain-effects/src/lib.rs`, adjacent tests.
- **Contract:** SPEC L-09, B-39 item 1; STATE-MACHINES "VerificationRun"; AC-012.
- **Change intent:** `verify_child_result` admits a verifier Attempt whose AgentBinding differs from the producing worker's (checked in storage, not only in the service), with a read-only Environment pinned to the produced revision; settles PASSED, FAILED or INCONCLUSIVE (timeout); refuses to start during PAUSE_REQUESTED or CANCEL_REQUESTED; never moves the Task to COMPLETED.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Verifier on the producing worker's binding is rejected in storage (AC-012).
  - [ ] Timeout yields INCONCLUSIVE; a PASS leaves the Task non-terminal (AC-012).
  - [ ] No run starts while PAUSE_REQUESTED or CANCEL_REQUESTED.
- **Command:** `cargo test -p storage-sqlite --locked verification_run` and `cargo test -p litecoworkd --locked independent_verification` (second filter to be added by this task)
- **Evidence:** test output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** the verifier shares a writable handle with the producer.

## 015-T11 - Operator routes, authorization and Tauri bridge commands

- **Status:** PARTIAL - `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/lead-agent` and `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/verification-runs` are served behind `authenticate`; no pause, resume, steering, activity or workers route; no Tauri bridge for any of them.
- **Depends on:** T01, T02, T04-T10
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 011 IPC profile (Windows named pipe and Linux socket) and Feature 005 T10 (`cancel_task` route).
- **Owner:** Operator/API, Desktop shell.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/src/operator.rs` (route merge only), `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_control_operator.rs` (new), `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_lead_handoff_operator.rs`, `apps/litecoworkd/src/verification_runs_operator.rs`, `apps/litecowork-ui/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (command registration), `apps/litecowork-ui/src-tauri/src/task_control_bridge.rs` (new), `apps/litecowork-ui/src/api/operator-api.ts` (generated), `docs/schemas/served-route-inventory.json` (regenerated).
- **Contract:** SPEC section 7.2; API; LOCAL-OPERATOR-IPC; AC-002, AC-013, AC-019.
- **Change intent:** mount pause, resume, steering, activity and workers routes with Workspace-owner checks, If-Match, Idempotency-Key, body limits (8 KiB control, 16 KiB steering), `Cache-Control: no-store`; include `allowed_commands` in the Task projection from the daemon's transition table. Add Tauri commands `pause_task`, `resume_task`, `steer_task`, `change_task_lead`, `list_task_activity`, `list_task_workers`, `list_task_verification_runs` that validate identifiers and never pass host paths.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Each route: unauthenticated 401, foreign Workspace 404, stale If-Match 409, replay returns stored receipt (AC-002, AC-019).
  - [ ] Racing commands through the route: one wins (AC-013).
  - [ ] Served-route inventory regenerated and matches the OpenAPI.
- **Command:** `cargo test -p litecoworkd --locked task_control_operator` (filter to be added by this task) and `cargo test -p litecowork-ui --locked task_control_bridge` (filter to be added by this task) and `python3 scripts/audit_served_routes.py`
- **Evidence:** test output; route inventory diff in the PR.
- **Stop:** a route admits a command the transition table forbids.

## 015-T12 - Work-screen controls: Pause, Resume, Steer, Cancel, Change lead

- **Status:** NOT STARTED - `TaskDetailPanel` in `apps/litecowork-ui/src/App.tsx` has no execution controls.
- **Depends on:** T01, T11
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T13 (`TaskExecutionPanel.tsx` and `task-execution-state.ts`); Feature 011 app-wide keyboard and focus baseline.
- **Owner:** Desktop UI.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/TaskControls.tsx` (new), `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/task-control-state.ts` (new), `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/TaskExecutionPanel.tsx`, `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/task-execution-state.ts`, `apps/litecowork-ui/src/App.tsx` (`TaskDetailPanel` mount only), `apps/litecowork-ui/tests/task-control-state.test.ts` (new).
- **Contract:** [contracts/ui-behavior.md](contracts/ui-behavior.md); V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT section 3 "Controls"; AC-016.
- **Change intent:** a toolbar on Task detail with Pause, Resume, Steer (dialog with class selector and body), Cancel (confirm dialog naming active children) and Change lead (binding picker limited to eligible bindings). Enabled state comes only from `allowed_commands`; pending shows "Pausing", "Cancelling"; 409 refetches and announces the change in an `aria-live="polite"` region. Pure state logic in `task-control-state.ts`.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Disabled controls expose an accessible reason; all reachable by Tab with a visible focus ring (AC-016).
  - [ ] 409 refetch announces "This Task changed; showing the latest state." (AC-016).
  - [ ] Offline and denied states render with repair text, no optimistic state change.
- **Command:** `pnpm --dir apps/litecowork-ui test` and `pnpm --dir apps/litecowork-ui run build`
- **Evidence:** test output; screenshot set in the evidence bundle.
- **Stop:** the UI computes allowed transitions itself.

## 015-T13 - Activity timeline and Workers view

- **Status:** NOT STARTED - no timeline component; V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT section 3 records the gap.
- **Depends on:** T01, T11
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T13 (Task execution panel).
- **Owner:** Desktop UI, Presentation Operator.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_control_operator.rs` (activity and workers projections), `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/TaskActivityTimeline.tsx` (new), `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/TaskWorkersView.tsx` (new), `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/task-activity.ts` (new), `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/task-stream.ts`, `apps/litecowork-ui/tests/task-activity.test.ts` (new).
- **Contract:** contracts/ui-behavior.md; V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT section 3 "Activity", "Workers", "Mission Control"; AC-015, AC-018, AC-020.
- **Change intent:** Activity renders bounded pages (cursor, limit 1..200) of owner events with actor, Attempt, lease epoch, timestamps and correlation; Workers lists lead, children and verifiers with AgentModule and version, DelegationProfile revision, Environment class, budget used, outcome and verification. Native sub-agent reports render as "Reported by the agent (not managed by LiteCowork)". Live updates through `task-stream.ts` with resync on gap. Use list virtualization only if AC-020 fails without it.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Only owner-recorded states render; no percent, ETA or invented presence (AC-015).
  - [ ] Native sub-agent activity labelled REPORTED and not listed as a child Attempt (AC-018).
  - [ ] 200-entry page renders with no main-thread task over 100 ms in the harness (AC-020).
  - [ ] Loading, empty, error, denied, offline, stale and recovery states each have a test.
- **Command:** `pnpm --dir apps/litecowork-ui test` and `cargo test -p litecoworkd --locked task_activity_projection` (filter to be added by this task)
- **Evidence:** test output; performance trace in the evidence bundle.
- **Stop:** the projection needs data the owner does not record; fix the owner first.

## 015-T14 - Windows row: delegation and execution controls UNAVAILABLE until B-35

- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Depends on:** T01, T11
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T14 (Windows Task execution UNAVAILABLE reason).
- **Owner:** Task Runtime, Desktop UI.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_control_operator.rs`, `apps/litecoworkd/src/delegation_admission_service.rs`, `apps/litecowork-ui/src/tasks/task-control-state.ts`, `apps/litecowork-ui/tests/task-control-state.test.ts`.
- **Contract:** SPEC section 12; Feature 005 B-17 rider and B-35; AC-017.
- **Change intent:** on Windows, the Task projection omits child admission, handoff Attempt, resume-with-continuation and verification from `allowed_commands` with the typed reason from Feature 005; pause and cancel of a Task without active Attempts remain. No text calls a Job Object a sandbox.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Windows projection reports the four operations UNAVAILABLE with the typed reason (AC-017).
  - [ ] Pause and cancel of a READY Task still succeed on Windows (AC-017).
- **Command:** `cargo test -p litecoworkd --locked task_control_windows_unavailable` (filter to be added by this task) and `pnpm --dir apps/litecowork-ui test`
- **Evidence:** Windows-row screenshot and projection JSON in the evidence bundle.
- **Stop:** any Windows path could admit a child Attempt.

## 015-T15 - Failure and recovery suite

- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Depends on:** T01, T04-T10
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T11 (startup sweep for Attempts and Effects).
- **Owner:** Task Runtime, Storage.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/src/task_control_service.rs`, `apps/litecoworkd/src/runtime.rs` (startup sweep hook only), `apps/litecoworkd/tests/task_control_delegation.rs` (new), `crates/storage-sqlite/src/task_control_tests.rs`.
- **Contract:** SPEC section 11; contracts/errors-recovery.md; FAILURE-RECOVERY; AC-007, AC-013, AC-014.
- **Change intent:** startup sweep resumes `task_control_requests` that are not settled: new incarnation never renews prior leases, prior Attempts become ABANDONED, Effects reconcile before any replacement, then the pause or cancel completes from its durable record. Inject crash at each step of pause, cancel fan-out, handoff and child admission; inject timeout after worker dispatch; duplicate replay of every command; cancel racing a child completion.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Each crash point leaves a recoverable durable state and never reports PAUSED or CANCELLED without quiescence (AC-014).
  - [ ] Duplicate replay returns stored receipts; late results after restart are fenced (AC-007).
  - [ ] Cancellation racing a completing child: the earlier committed outcome wins (AC-013).
- **Command:** `cargo test -p litecoworkd --test task_control_delegation --locked recovery` (target and filter to be added by this task)
- **Evidence:** test output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** any UNKNOWN outcome is treated as success.

## 015-T16 - Cross-layer traces for every user-visible operation

- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Depends on:** T01, T11-T15
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** NONE
- **Owner:** Product, each component owner.
- **Allowed paths:** `specs/015-task-control-delegation/contracts/ui-behavior.md`, `specs/015-task-control-delegation/WIRING.yaml`, `docs/V1-UI-ACTION-STATE-LEDGER.md`, `docs/SEMANTIC-SERVED-UI-MAP.md`.
- **Contract:** AGENTS.md section 4; AC-001 to AC-021.
- **Change intent:** for Pause, Resume, Steer, Cancel, Change lead, delegated Step, verification and timeline view record: user outcome, screen and control, Tauri command, route, authorization, service, transaction and fence, event and receipt, projection, restart path and evidence test name.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Every control has a route and every route has a control or is marked daemon-internal (child admission).
  - [ ] Each trace cites a passing test.
- **Command:** `python3 .specify/scripts/validate_feature_package.py` and `python3 scripts/audit_v1_contracts.py`
- **Evidence:** trace table in contracts/ui-behavior.md.
- **Stop:** a control has no owner route.

## 015-T17 - Linux-row qualification of the B-39 pair (CODE, SYSTEM, USER)

- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Depends on:** T01-T16
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T15 (Linux E2E-04 qualified); Feature 019 release matrix rows and evidence bundle process; Feature 011 Linux socket profile qualified.
- **Owner:** Product, Release, repository owner (USER evidence).
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecoworkd/tests/task_control_delegation.rs`, `apps/litecowork-ui/tests/` (E2E driver files for this journey), evidence bundle path defined by Feature 019, `CURRENT-RUN.md`.
- **Contract:** SPEC section 15; ACCEPTANCE-AND-E2E-PLAN (new gate-E delegation row, id assigned by the orchestrator, extends E2E-04); AC-020, AC-021.
- **Change intent:** create the canonical test target `task_control_delegation`; run the packaged desktop journey on Linux x86_64 with OpenCode v2.0.32 lead and the pinned Claude Code CLI worker: delegate, verify, pause, resume, steer, hand off, cancel; include denial (allowlist miss, sharing request), crash and restart, late-result fence and performance measurements.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Canonical command passes on the Linux row with recorded build, OS, harness versions and auth routes (AC-021).
  - [ ] AC-020 measurements recorded on the release-row machine.
  - [ ] Owner USER evidence signed for the exact build.
- **Command:** `cargo test -p litecoworkd --test task_control_delegation --locked -- --nocapture`
- **Evidence:** evidence bundle entry and IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS row with class QUALIFIED for the Linux row only.
- **Stop:** any denial or recovery case fails; do not claim QUALIFIED.

## 015-T18 - Windows-row qualification after B-35

- **Status:** BLOCKED - Feature 005 B-35 is PROPOSED (owner: repository owner) and no Windows Environment provider exists.
- **Depends on:** T01, T14, T17
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 005 T17 (Windows Environment provider) and Feature 005 T18 (Windows E2E-04 qualified); Feature 011 Windows named-pipe profile qualified.
- **Owner:** Product, Release, repository owner.
- **Allowed paths:** same as T17.
- **Contract:** SPEC section 12; AC-017, AC-021.
- **Change intent:** until B-35 qualifies, record Windows-row evidence that AC-017 UNAVAILABLE behaviour holds in the packaged app; after B-35 qualifies, rerun the T17 journey on Windows x64.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Pre-B-35: packaged Windows build shows the UNAVAILABLE reason and admits nothing (AC-017).
  - [ ] Post-B-35: canonical command and USER journey pass on Windows x64 (AC-021).
- **Command:** `cargo test -p litecoworkd --test task_control_delegation --locked -- --nocapture`
- **Evidence:** evidence bundle entry for the Windows row.
- **Stop:** a Job Object-only configuration is presented as qualified.

## 015-T19 - Documentation and ledger sync

- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Depends on:** T01, T16, T17
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** NONE (orchestrator owns shared docs and closes register rows).
- **Owner:** Documentation owner, orchestrator.
- **Allowed paths:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`, `docs/V1-UI-ACTION-STATE-LEDGER.md`, `docs/V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT.md` (section 3 current boundary only), `docs/ACCEPTANCE-AND-E2E-PLAN.md` (delegation row), `docs/schemas/served-route-inventory.json`, `CURRENT-RUN.md`.
- **Contract:** AGENTS.md sections 3 and 5; AC-015, AC-016.
- **Change intent:** update capability rows (pause, resume, steer, cancel, handoff, delegation, verification, Work timeline) with exact evidence class per row; regenerate the served-route inventory; record the gate-E E2E row.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] No row claims more than its evidence (Windows row stays UNAVAILABLE until T18).
  - [ ] `scripts/audit_served_routes.py` output matches the OpenAPI.
- **Command:** `python3 scripts/audit_served_routes.py` and `python3 .specify/scripts/validate_feature_package.py`
- **Evidence:** PR diff.
- **Stop:** a status upgrade lacks an evidence reference.

## 015-T20 - Mission Control canvas and read-only Compare Agents fan-out (P-14)

- **Status:** NOT STARTED - added under this package's IN_REVIEW status. Folds proposed task P-14 from docs/REFERENCE-SYNTHESIS-AND-V1-FEATURE-ALIGNMENT-2026-11.md section 8 into this package.
- **Depends on:** T13, T16
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 001 turn activity records and Feature 005 Attempt records as the runtime read sources.
- **Owner:** Task Control, Desktop UI.
- **Allowed paths:** `apps/litecowork-ui/src/`, `apps/litecoworkd/src/`, `specs/015-task-control-delegation/contracts/ui-behavior.md`, adjacent tests.
- **Contract:** SPEC §12; AC-015, AC-022; V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT; PRESENTATION-RUNTIME.
- **Change intent:** add a Mission Control canvas that shows the delegation tree, step status, live tool activity, approvals and evidence, bound to real runtime records and shown only after the first bounded workflow is proven; and an explicitly-requested read-only Compare Agents fan-out that runs the same prompt across chosen agents for comparison without mutating a Task or creating authority. An absent runtime record renders unavailable, never fabricated. The list itself defers agent swarms past V1; this task does not add swarm orchestration.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] The canvas renders the delegation tree, step status, live tool activity, approvals and evidence from real runtime records only (AC-022).
  - [ ] Compare Agents is read-only, explicitly requested, and never mutates a Task or creates authority (AC-022).
  - [ ] The canvas is shown only after a bounded workflow is proven; an absent record renders unavailable (AC-015, AC-022).
- **Command:** `python3 .specify/scripts/validate_feature_package.py` and `pnpm --dir apps/litecowork-ui test`
- **Evidence:** canvas and Compare Agents test output in Completion evidence.
- **Stop:** the canvas would show a value with no runtime record; render it unavailable rather than infer.

## 015-T21 - Package VERIFIED for V1

- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Depends on:** T01-T20
- **Cross-package prerequisites:** Feature 019 release evidence bundle accepted.
- **Owner:** Product, repository owner.
- **Allowed paths:** `specs/015-task-control-delegation/`.
- **Contract:** SPECIFICATION-STANDARD lifecycle; AC-001 to AC-022.
- **Change intent:** assemble the evidence bundle (per-task revision, command, result, OS, harness, reviewer); move status ACCEPTED/LOCKED to IMPLEMENTING when T02 starts and to VERIFIED when every task closes and the owner signs off.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] Every AC has a passing test reference on the Linux row; Windows row is either qualified or recorded UNAVAILABLE with B-35 open.
  - [ ] Owner sign-off recorded.
- **Command:** `python3 .specify/scripts/validate_feature_package.py` and `cargo test -p litecoworkd --test task_control_delegation --locked -- --nocapture`
- **Evidence:** Completion evidence table below.
- **Stop:** any AC lacks evidence.

## Dependency order

T01 -> T02 -> T03 -> (T04, T05 in parallel) -> T06 and T07 (both after T04) -> T08 (after T02, T03) -> T09 and T10 (after T08) -> T11 (after T04-T10) -> (T12, T13, T14 in parallel) -> T15 (after T04-T10) -> T16 (after T11-T15) -> T17 -> T18 (blocked on B-35) and T19. (T13, T16) -> T20 (Mission Control canvas, P-14). (T18, T19, T20) -> T21 (VERIFIED).

## Cross-package dependencies

| This task | Other package task | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| T04, T07, T08 | 005-T08 | Attempt admission with attestation and lease epoch is the only way to start any Attempt |
| T04, T06, T15 | 005-T11 | Single-Attempt cancel, quiescence and startup sweep are reused by pause and fan-out cancel |
| T06, T11 | 005-T10 | `cancel_task` route and bridge are extended, not duplicated |
| T08 | 005-T04 | Linux bubblewrap provider supplies `ATTEMPT_PRIVATE` Environments |
| T10 | 005-T09 | Independent file verifier and Effect reconciliation |
| T12, T13 | 005-T13 | Controls and timeline mount in `TaskExecutionPanel.tsx` |
| T14 | 005-T14 | Same typed Windows UNAVAILABLE reason |
| T17 | 005-T15 | Linux E2E-04 must pass before delegation qualifies |
| T18 | 005-T17 | Windows Environment provider (B-35) |
| T18 | 005-T18 | Windows E2E-04 qualified first |
| T08 | 004-T05 | Claude Code dispatch arm in `AgentSessionSupervisor` |
| T08 | 002-T12 | Claude Code CLI AgentModule (B-11) |
| T08 | Feature 009 Coworker revision editing of `enabled_delegation_profile_ids` | Allowlist must be owner-editable |
| T09 | Feature 020 Needs You producer | NEEDS_YOU destination for `on_exhaustion` |
| T11, T17, T18 | Feature 011 IPC profiles (Windows named pipe, Linux socket) | Packaged desktop transport |
| T12 | Feature 011 app-wide keyboard and focus baseline | Control accessibility |
| T17, T20 | Feature 019 release matrix rows and evidence bundle | Qualification is per release row |

Feature 009, 011, 019 and 020 task plans are being written in the same release-planning pass, so those rows name the outcome; the orchestrator resolves them to task IDs in the traceability index.

## Completion evidence

For each task append a row when it closes: task, code revision (SHA), exact command, result (pass/fail with counts), OS and build (Linux x86_64 distribution or Windows 11/10 x64), harness and version (OpenCode v2.0.32 lead, Claude Code CLI version), auth route, evidence class reached (CODE, SYSTEM, USER), report path and reviewer. Statuses above are source-audit classifications at this revision, not qualification.

| Task | Revision | Command | Result | OS/build | Harness/version | Class | Reviewer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (none yet) | | | | | | | |

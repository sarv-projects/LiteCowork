# Plan - Safe Task Path

**Feature:** 005 | **Status:** ACCEPTED/LOCKED - owner-accepted 2026-11-09; authorizes implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.

## Phases

1. Contract promotion (T01): owner docs, OpenAPI, error codes, events and the next immutable SQLite migration in one change.
2. Foundations in parallel (T02-T07, T12): type/probe consolidation, plan acceptance storage, Linux bubblewrap provider and attestation, planning dispatch, B-18 replace primitive, Trust/grant wiring, Conversation promotion.
3. Execution path (T08-T11): Attempt admission, reconciliation and verification, Operator routes and Tauri bridge, cancel/crash/restart recovery.
4. UI (T13-T14): Work execution panel and the Windows-row UNAVAILABLE posture.
5. Linux-row qualification (T15) with the desktop USER path in [ACCEPTANCE-AND-E2E-PLAN.md](../../docs/ACCEPTANCE-AND-E2E-PLAN.md) E2E-04.
6. B-35 Windows provider (T16 owner decision, T17 implementation, T18 Windows-row qualification), after the Linux slice.
7. Documentation sync (T19) and VERIFIED (T20).

## Dependency DAG

- T01 blocks every implementation task; T16 is an owner decision that only blocks T17 and T18. The full DAG is in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md#dependency-order).
- External side effects never run inside the transactions declared in WIRING.yaml.
- Feature 001 remains a prerequisite wherever this slice needs a committed Conversation turn.

## Owners and file scope

Owners: Task Runtime, Environments, Trust, Storage, Desktop UI.
Allowed implementation paths are listed per task. The active source tree is in apps/ and crates/. Changes remain limited to the task-owned paths and require package acceptance, a clean selected worktree, and source/contract/UI/test reconciliation.

## Migration, rollout, rollback

No migration has shipped for this package yet. T01 promotes one forward-only immutable migration (`docs/schemas/sqlite-v36.sql` per the Migration allocation in docs/LITECOWORK-BUILD-TASKS.md; v28 through v32 are already wired and a merged migration is never renumbered; if another package merges first take the next free number and update that table). Rollback is revert to the previous committed revision and refuse new admission that needs the new field.

## Risks

- Implementing B-35 work before the owner accepts B-35.
- Shipping a Windows build that admits an Attempt with a Job Object as the only boundary.
- Treating archive CODE as current qualification.
- Collapsing distinct states into one UI boolean.

## Verification gates

- `python3 .specify/scripts/validate_feature_package.py`
- Owner review recorded 2026-11-09 for B-17/B-18; B-35 pending
- TASKS.md commands and denial, replay, restart and cancel cases

## DeepSeek Harness proposals (PROPOSED, owner review required)

PROPOSED only; see the matching section in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md). Nothing here changes the accepted design of this package. Owner review is required first.

- **P-38 Login-shell PATH-class capture for agents launched from a Linux desktop entry** (touches this package; row owned by package 002). Class **OWNER (open; not ADOPT, ADAPT or REJECT yet)**. Design impact if accepted: T07 and T13 of package 002; package 005 Environment admission. CONFLICT with environment scrubbing (A-58): stays open. Deferral: Blocked on the owner decision. Then a Linux desktop-entry launch test.

Study: [desktop study](../../docs/DEEPSEEK-HARNESS-DESKTOP-DEEP-DIVE-2026-11.md) Section 14 (row P-38 and the conflict note).
- **P-27 durable run record plus process-group liveness fence** (ADAPT): see TASKS.md PROP-P27 / plugin lessons. Study: [plugin study](../../docs/DEEPSEEK-HARNESS-PLUGIN-ARCHITECTURE-DEEP-DIVE-2026-11.md) Sections 2, 3 and 8.

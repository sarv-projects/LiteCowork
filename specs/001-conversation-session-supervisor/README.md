# 001 - Conversation Session Supervisor and Native Turn Execution

- **Status:** ACCEPTED/LOCKED - owner-accepted 2026-11-09; authorizes implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.
- **Revision:** 1.1 | **Updated:** 2026-11-09 | **Owner acceptance:** B-01 to B-10 accepted 2026-11-09 via [docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md](../../docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md); first route to qualify is OpenCode v2.0.32 on Windows x64 (B-02 rider).
- **Implementation state (2026-11-11):** CODE and SERVED, no product-managed live OpenCode run and no QUALIFIED row. DONE: T02, T06, T07, T08, T10, T11, T13, T15, T16, T17, T18, T19, T20, T24, T26. PARTIAL: T01, T03, T04, T05 (B-07 window; measured OpenCode input budget remains unconfirmed, O-05), T14 (text ResourceRef attachments only), T21, T22, T23, T25 (REPORTED activity), T27 (permission display only). BLOCKED: T12 (no evidenced provider input-request event). NOT STARTED: T09, T28 (live packaged journey and release evidence). Migrations v28 to v30 are wired. Details: TASKS.md and docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md.
- **Owners:** Conversation, Agent Runtime, Storage, Operator/API, Desktop UI, Security/Trust and Product.

## User outcome

A user can send an ordinary LiteCowork Conversation message through the exact selected native agent, see truthful progress, stop/retry safely and reload the durable answer after restart, without creating a Task or Coworker.

## Current truth

The active source contains an OpenCode-only supervisor path and code-level durability, single-flight, stop/retry, bounded-context, and attachment foundations. Current task-level implementation and exact evidence are tracked in TASKS.md and docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md. The host OpenCode v2.0.32 CLI is installed and its auth list reports stored provider entries, but no product-managed authenticated send/stop/retry/restart journey or live input-request event capture has been completed. The remaining lifecycle and qualification gaps stay release-blocking.

By owner approval on 2026-11-09 (see [docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md](../../docs/OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-PACKET.md)), this package also folds the audit's cowork-visibility tasks P-00, P-01, P-02, P-04 and P-09 (001-T23 to 001-T27): a redacted OpenCode v2.0.32 turn fixture, the OpenCodeEventNormalizer, transient activity frames with REPORTED records, stick-to-bottom autoscroll, and native permission prompts surfaced inline and in Needs You (jointly with Feature 002). Source: [docs/UI-RENDERING-SETTINGS-ARCHITECTURE-AUDIT-2026-11.md](../../docs/UI-RENDERING-SETTINGS-ARCHITECTURE-AUDIT-2026-11.md) section 9.

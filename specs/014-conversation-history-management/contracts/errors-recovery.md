# Error and Recovery Contract - Feature 014

**Status:** IN_REVIEW - not owner-accepted; does not authorize implementation; not a claim of implementation or qualification.
**Owners:** Conversation, Storage, Privacy, Desktop UI.
**Canonical owners:** [Failure Recovery](../../../docs/FAILURE-RECOVERY.md), [State Machines](../../../docs/STATE-MACHINES.md), [API](../../../docs/API.md), [Storage](../../../docs/STORAGE.md).

## 1. Classification and client rule

| Class | Examples | Server action | Client action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Owner/scope denial | foreign principal, foreign Workspace, archived Workspace | deny before mutation | show denial; no retry |
| Version conflict | stale If-Match | `STALE_VERSION`; no write | refresh row; reapply intent with a new key |
| Replay conflict | same key, different payload | `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` | new key only for changed intent |
| Invalid input | empty or over-long title, control characters, oversized query | `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | keep the edit open with the reason |
| Active turn | archive or delete while a turn is nonterminal | `CONVERSATION_TURN_IN_PROGRESS` | disable control with reason until settled |
| Not quiescent | unsettled Conversation-scoped invocation, grant, activation or open UserRequest | `CONVERSATION_NOT_QUIESCENT` with blocker list | show blockers in impact preview |
| Archived | submit, retry, binding change, rename on ARCHIVED | `CONVERSATION_ARCHIVED` | offer Unarchive |
| Deleted | any read or write after tombstone | 410 `CONVERSATION_DELETED` | show deleted state; remove from lists |
| Index building | backfill running | 200 with `index_state=BUILDING` | show "Search index is building" |
| Storage unavailable | writer stopped, timeout | `DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE` | show offline; retry read |

## 2. Retry classes

- **SAFE_READ_RETRY:** list, search, impact, deletion status.
- **SAFE_LOCAL_REPLAY:** same principal, key and payload for rename, archive, unarchive, delete.
- **RECONCILER_RETRY:** purge targets stay PENDING until physically removed; retried with backoff; restart resumes.

## 3. Crash windows

| Window | Recovery |
|---|---|
| Before deletion transaction commits | Nothing changed; client replay with the same key re-runs it |
| After tombstone, before any purge | Fences hold; reconciler starts at Runtime startup |
| Mid-purge | Pending receipts resume; acknowledged targets are not re-processed |
| After last acknowledgement, before completion | Completion check runs on resume and commits DELETED |
| Backup taken during DELETION_PENDING, then restored | Tombstone and plan restored; purge resumes; content never readable |
| Index backfill interrupted | Watermark resumes; state stays BUILDING |

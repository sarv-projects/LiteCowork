//! Daemon restart and orphan recovery sweep for Conversation turns (001-T08).
//!
//! V1 has no same-incarnation resume of a native session, so at startup (before the
//! Operator accepts commands) every Conversation attempt that was in flight under a
//! prior incarnation is settled FAILED with a typed reason and its AgentSession is
//! ended LOST. The USER message is never touched, no AGENT message is invented, and the
//! turn shows a failure that offers Retry. Unknown native state is never reported as
//! completed. The sweep is idempotent: settled turns and ended sessions are skipped.

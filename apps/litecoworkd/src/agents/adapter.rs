//! The native-agent adapter boundary (001-T04, 002-T17).
//!
//! This module defines the provider-neutral [`AgentAdapter`] trait that the
//! Conversation supervisor drives through the B-03 three-phase handshake, the
//! ACP client spine (`initialize` / `session.new` / `session.prompt` /
//! `session.update` / `session.cancel`, plus the client-side
//! `request_permission`, filesystem and terminal surfaces) described in
//! Feature 002 T17, a per-provider launch catalog that selects a provider by
//! exact identity, and the first concrete adapter: an [`OpenCodeAdapter`] that
//! wraps the existing bounded [`OpenCodeServer`] HTTP transport and the
//! [`OpenCodeEventNormalizer`].
//!
//! Boundaries that do not move (AGENTS.md, SPEC 7.4/8/10):
//! - A native subprocess owns reasoning, authentication, model catalogs and
//!   native tools. LiteCowork stays the Client that owns permission decisions,
//!   filesystem access, terminals and evidence. No ACP surface converts a
//!   native tool action into a LiteCowork Effect.
//! - Provider events are untrusted until normalized and correlated. The adapter
//!   never lets an uncorrelated, foreign-session, oversized or malformed frame
//!   mutate state or projection.
//! - The OpenCode v2 HTTP path is one non-ACP adapter and stays that way until
//!   OpenCode's own ACP route qualifies. The ACP client spine here is the
//!   provider-neutral path the other providers take.
